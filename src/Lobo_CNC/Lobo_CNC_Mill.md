# Lobo CNC Mill
## General Process
Ideally you came here with a general understanding of the CNC Milling process.

If not, the generic CNC milling process (for this guide) consists of:  
**A. Capture your design in a computer program.**  
Not addressed in this guide.  
**B. Transform your design into CNC Tool instructions.**  
Not addressed in this guide. 
**C. Setup the Tool and run the Tool Instructions.**  
The objective of this guide: How to set up and run the Lobo CNC Mill. 

**The assumption is you are here with your G-code in a text file.**  

## Safety
This guide assumes you have an understanding of personal safety involving machinery. This is a loud, strong, sharp, spinning machine that may move without warning. If you have questions, concerns,or are unsure about your safety, ask someone first.  

To **STOP all mill movement**, click on the Feed Hold button, on the display.  
This **WILL NOT Stop the Router Bit** from spinning.
