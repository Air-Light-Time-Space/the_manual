Running a collective space shouldn't be lonely, let's help each other out.

Two things you can do:

1. [Edit or add to this manual](editing.md) if you know something that could
   help us run the space.
2. Subscribe and add to the shared [Administrative Chores
   Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=ZnMwcXZidmc4cXQ5aGxzOGg3amI2ZmVobDBAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)
   so we can remind ourselves when something is due.
