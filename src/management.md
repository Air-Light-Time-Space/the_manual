# Management

Day-to-day management of the space can be performed on an ad-hoc basis
by anyone who has the time and understands the problem. If you notice
something that needs to be done, perhaps you would be a good person to
do it. If you don't know how to do something ask someone who has done
it before, then add the information to this wiki!

Access to sensitive information (accounts, credentials, keys, etc) is
available on a need-to-know basis. If you need to know, ask around and
someone will tell you.

Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of members should only be
shared with directors of the board or agents duly authorized by the
board to handle such data.

If you have time and you love the space consider stepping up to help
keep the place running. By managing the space collectively we ensure
the needs of the space can adapt to changes in membership or conditions
on the ground.
