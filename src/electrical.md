ðŸš¨ The building is currently under heavy renovation, so the details here are
likely to change.

Most of the main space and the metal shop are wired into the "High Voltage"
closet in the main space. This door is locked to slow down modifications from
cavalier hackers (apparently this has been an issue in the past). If a circuit
blows, ask around and you can probably find a way in to get it reset.

The woodshop and half of the garage east of the woodshop (Scott's shop) are
inexplicably wired to a breaker that lives way over yonder in the eastern most
garage. Scott's shop also has a new separate dedicated run. Allegedly all the
garages will get their own dedicated circuits run as part of the ongoing
renovation.ðŸ¤ž
