# Electrical

ðŸš¨ The building is currently under heavy renovation, so the details here are
likely to change.

Most of the main space and the metal shop are wired into the "High Voltage"
closet in the main space. This door is locked to slow down modifications from
cavalier hackers (apparently this has been an issue in the past). If a circuit
blows, ask around and you can probably find a way in to get it reset.

## Woodhsop

The legacy wiring in the woodshop is prone to flipping the circuit breaker, especially when working with hard woods in the table saw or planer.

The woodshop and half of the garage east of the woodshop (Scott's shop) are
inexplicably wired to a breaker that lives way over yonder in the eastern most
garage. Scott's shop also has a new separate dedicated run. Allegedly all the
garages will get their own dedicated circuits run as part of the ongoing
renovation before too long.ðŸ¤ž

In the meanwhile, gain access to the eastern most garage and reset the woodshop breaker. 
It's actually two switches, joined together with a metal collar (see photo below).

When the switch is blown you'll first have to push them all the way off to reset, and then back on.
