## Garage door maintenance

When working in the shops with the garage doors open a layer of dust
tends to settle on the top of the open door. Later when that door is
closed it looks much filthier than the other doors around it. After a
couple weeks it can start looking really bad. This is a pet peeve of
our landlord's, so please **take a moment to dust off the exterior of the
garage door after you have been working with it open for an extended time**.

Depending on how often the doors are being dusted off by day-to-day users
the doors need to be deep cleaned anywhere from once a month to
once a week. To deep clean the doors use the 100' hose and sprayer located
in a tub above the vent hood in the main space. You can connect the hose
to the spigot outside just to the right as you exit the side door. The hose
should easily stretch down the side walkway and around to reach all three
of our garage doors.

Clean the doors off gently with water and sponge, sweep or spray off the
sidewalk if there is a lot of dust outside of our space. If you decide to
use anything other than water to clean the doors, be aware that the runoff
to the street drains will drain directly into the Puget Sound.

Keeping our space looking nice encourages passerbys to treat it with respect
and helps us get away with disturbing the neighborhood all day long with our
loud noises and activities.
