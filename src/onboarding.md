# Onboarding

Any current member can onboard a new member to the space.

Make sure that the new member:
* Has filled out a [waiver](waivers.md)
* Has read and understands the [rules of the space](https://altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/)
* Has made at least one payment of membership dues by cash, check, or paypal

If all of the above is true, you can tell them the codes and welcome them to the space! Have them send an email to the space manager to get an invitation to the mailing list and shared calendar.

Blank waivers can be found in the filing cabinet just to your right as you walk in the keypad door. Completed waivers can be left in the cash deposit box (on that same wall next to the first aid kit).

## Orientation essentials

Altspace is a special place, and might operate differently from what people are used to.

At a minimum, you should go over these things:

- Exterior door: there's a little jiggle dance you have to do to get it open. Have them try.
- Close doors/lock up when you leave.
- There is no one responsible for cleaning up your messes except yourself,
  so clean up after yourself + an extra 20%.
- Tag/tape system:
  - red (private)
  - yellow (with permission)
  - blue or untagged (public)
- Ask the new member what project(s) they are pursuing so you can give them any specific tool orientations relevant to them,
  or if it's a machine you aren't familiar with, help them ask in discord

## Communication channels

Currently, most day to day chatter is on our [Discord chat
server](https://discord.com/channels/834243114339401759/834243243989663744).

There is also the [altspace-seattle
google-group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/altspace-seattle) mailing list.

We use a shared google calendar to coordinate sharing high demand resources like the woodshop. You're welcome to stop by without a reservation, but if someone already has it reserved, they get priority. Ensure that your fellow members have fair opportunities to use the space by making your reservations not too frequent or long.
