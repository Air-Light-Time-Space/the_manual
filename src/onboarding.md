# Onboarding

Any current member can onboard a new member to the space.

Make sure that the new member:
* Has filled out a [waiver](waivers.md)
* Has read and understands the [rules of the space](https://altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/)
* Has made at least one payment of membership dues by cash, check, or paypal

If all of the above is true, you can tell them the codes and welcome them to the space! Have them send an email to the space manager to get an invitation to the mailing list.

Blank waivers can be found in the black filing cabinet near the side-walkway door in the main space. Completed waivers can be left in the cash deposit box (on that same wall above the first aid kit).
