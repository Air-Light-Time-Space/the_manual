# Onboarding

Any current member can onboard a new member to the space.

Make sure that the new member:
* Has filled out a [waiver](waivers.md)
* Has read and understands the [rules of the space](https://altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/)
* Has made at least one payment of membership dues by cash, check, or paypal

If all of the above is true, you can tell them the codes and welcome them to the space! Have them send an email to the space manager to get an invitation to the mailing list and shared calendar.

Blank waivers can be found in the black filing cabinet near the side-walkway door in the main space. Completed waivers can be left in the cash deposit box (on that same wall above the first aid kit).


## Communication channels

Currently, most day to day chatter is on our [Discord chat
server](https://discord.com/channels/834243114339401759/834243243989663744).

There is also the [altspace-seattle
google-group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/altspace-seattle) mailing list.

We use a shared google calendar to coordinate sharing high demand resources like the woodshop. You're welcome to stop by without a reservation, but if someone already has it reserved, they get priority. Ensure that your fellow members have fair opportunities to use the space by making your reservations not too frequent or long.
