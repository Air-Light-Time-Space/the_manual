# Liability Waivers

**ALL** users of the space must complete and sign a
[Liability Waiver](https://altspaceseattle.com/ALTSpace_Liability_Waiver.pdf)
before making use of any of the tools or amenities at the space.

If you bring a guest into the space make sure they fill out a
waiver before they use any tools, or even if they're just going
to be hanging out for awhile.

Completed waivers are kept in the black safe near the side exit and are organized
into a number of folders:

* *Pro* - All currently active Pro members
* *Basic* - All currently active Basic members
* *Supporter* - All currently active Supporter members
* *Potential* - People who filled out a waiver but haven't signed up yet.
-- It's good to go through these every now and again and shred the ones
that are really old. If our membership is low, you can reach out to these
people before shredding their PII and ask if they're still interested in signing up.
* *Previous users* - Not really a folder, but a large stack of previous members/
users of the space, sorted reverse chronologically
* *Possibly not* - Waivers of previous users who we may not want to allow to
rejoin the space for whatever reason. Write notes on the back of the waiver.

If you have a waiver you need to file but you don't know the code to the safe,
you can fold it in half and stick it in the cash payments box near the first
aid kit.
