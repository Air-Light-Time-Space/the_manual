# Bi-yearly Air Compressor Servicing

Several compressed air lines run through the space. The air compressor lives to
your right as you enter the space. You'll hear it turn on from time to time.

It's good to check the compressor every 6 months or so to make sure it has oil.
There is a reminder to do this on the shared calendar. It's good to take a look
in the compressor room every so often more regularly than that to make sure there
are no problems.

Always disconnect the air compressor from power before any kind of servicing. 
The compressor has a large exposed belt and spinning wheel and can start suddenly 
at any time if not disabled. 

The large green thing next to the air compressor is an air drying unit, use it if you need the
air in the lines to be extra dry, but turn it off when you are done using it. The
tank under the compressor also has a timed discharge port at the back that discharges
any collected condensation on a regular interval (as long as it remains plugged in
and the outlet's protection switch hasn't tripped).
