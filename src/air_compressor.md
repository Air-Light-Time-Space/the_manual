# Bi-yearly Air Compressor Servicing

Several compressed air lines run through the space. The compressor lives under
the stairs in the alley, accessible from the back door in the main space.

It's good to check the compressor every 6 months or so to make sure it has oil.
There is a reminder to do this on the shared calendar. It's good to take a look
in the compressor room every so often more regularly than that to make sure there
are no problems.

On the east wall of the compressor room there is a grey metal switch box with a 
switch you can use to turn the compressor on and off. Always turn it off before
any kind of servicing. The compressor has a large exposed belt and spinning wheel
and can start suddenly at any time if not disabled. When working on or near the
compressor, put a ziptie or small padlock into the cover of the switch with a note
attached containing your name and contact info. This should help ensure no one
turns the compressor back on while it's in a compromised state.

The compressor room also has a fire extinguisher on the west wall, as well as an
office-style clip light you can reach for in the dark to illuminate the situation.

The large green thing in that room is an air drying unit, use it if you need the
air in the lines to be extra dry, but turn it off when you are done using it. The
tank under the compressor also has a timed discharge port at the back that discharges
any collected condensation on a regular interval (as long as it remains plugged in
and the outlet's protection switch hasn't tripped).
