# Bi-yearly Air Compressor Servicing

Several compressed air lines run through the space. The air compressor lives behind the member storage shelf on the first floor near the laser engravers.

It's good to check the compressor every 6 months or so to make sure it has oil.
There is a reminder to do this on the shared calendar.

Always disconnect the air compressor from power before any kind of servicing - there is a disconnect switch on the wall behind the compressor. The compressor has a large exposed belt and spinning wheel and can start suddenly 
at any time if not disabled. 

The large green thing next to the air compressor is an air drying unit, use it if you need the air in the lines to be extra dry, but turn it off when you are done using it. The
tank under the compressor also has a timed discharge port at the back that discharges
any collected condensation on a regular interval (as long as it remains plugged in
and the outlet's protection switch hasn't tripped).
