# Buying Things

All alt space members are expected to leave the space nicer than they found it.
Part of this is restocking maintenance supplies.

## You can make small purchases to keep the space running smoothly

You can buy anything on the [Shopping
List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17nph-7mVd-YzlKXFxk2uTholVokZJ7OVb105P4w_eaY/edit?usp=sharing)
and expect to be reimbursed. You can propose changes to the list at the next
member meeting. Unless otherwise noted on the shopping list, don't accrue more
than $50 of shopping without getting specific approval from a board member. Do
note that the treasurer reserves the right to veto any reimbursement in cases
of abuse.

After making your purchase, immediately email a reimbursement request to
<altspace-finance@googlegroups.com>.

It should include:

- what you bought
- how much it cost
- a photo of the receipt
- reimbursement method: either paypal or pick up a check from the space

**example**

    To: altspace-finance@googlegroups.com
    Subject: Reimbursement request: $8.40 for toilet paper

    Body:
    I bought $8.40 worth of toilet paper for the main space today.
    My paypal is: my-email@mydomain.com

    Attached: receipt.jpg

The treasurer will be responsible for processing reimbursements in a timely
manner, at least monthly.

## Board members can make larger discretionary purchases

Board members have more responsibilities for maintaining the space.
Consequently, they have larger discretionary purchasing power. In line with the
proposed by-laws, a board member can spend up to $500 on the space, provided at
least one other board member is informed.

If you are not a board member, and would like to make a larger-than-$50
reimbursable purchase, you must first either get the written approval of a
board member or bring a proposal to the next member meeting.

## For anything non-trivial

For trivial things like restocking toilet paper, just buy it. However for many
tools and replacement parts, other folks often have useful experience to inform
your purchase. If there's any reasonable doubt, even if you are a board member,
communicate on discord or the mailing list first. For more substantial
purchases, bring a proposal to the member meeting.

**example**

    To: altspace-seattle@googlegroups.com
    Subject: Purchase request: about $90.00 to fix the table saw

    Body:

    We need a new motor for the table saw cuz the old one burned out.

    I researched replacements and found this to be a good one, for about $70 +
    shipping: https://motors.com/really-good-deal/item-1337.html.

    It should be about $90 with shipping.

    Can I get reimbursement approval from a board member to buy this?


After any discussion, once you get approval, make the purchase and send your
approved reimbursement request to <altspace-finance@googlegroups.com>.
