## Banking
As per last night's meeting we're going to open a Alaska Federal account. I'll go get that done sometime this week, but I'm curious if anyone else is interested in being on the account, operating in an accounting or stewardship role? If so, let me know!

## Covid
The people have spoken. We're going to keep our existing protocol until phase 3 at which point we will re-assess. We all agreed that we should not open back up to guests/events until phase 4.
