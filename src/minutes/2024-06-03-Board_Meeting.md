## Matthew McKenzie: proposed purchasing a Directors and Officers (D&O) insurance policy

This would protect board member's personal liablity, up to $1MM.
Cost is about $1,300/year

Everyone present supported the proposal.

Additionally, Noah suggested looking to see if we could combine this policy with a general liability policy to save some money.

* ðŸ‘· MSM to purchase D&O policy.
* ðŸ‘· MSM to look into the possibility of combining policies under one provider to save money.
