## Assets
* Website lists - http://www.altspaceseattle.com/amenities-tools/
* some stuff checked out from owners. 

## Costs
* Currently renting for 3k, with extension space would be $4,300. Owner (Ron) keen to rent together.  Water sewer covered
* He’s more amenable to negotiating if it’s going to be taken over. Will be motivational since he’d otherwise spend a lot fixing it up. Offer / answer on sooner end. Could probably give tax deductible kickback written into lease.
* Fire permit - metal shop, roughly $450/yr, there’s extra for metal shop consumables.
* Internet $80/mo
* Electricity varies from $40 - $100/mo billed every 2 months.
* Insurance just lapsed, roughly $100 every 3rd month - liability insurance for the LLC.
* Currently no renters insurance for theft. Haven’t had real theft. Had a breakin, guy came through back. Used to be a gate in back, now plywood. Not easy to get in, better for security but harder for access.
* $115/year CPI updates.
 
## Membership

http://www.altspaceseattle.com/memberships-rates/

7 pro level members, 20 something $75 members, also got storage. Members have been self selecting because small space shared. Interactions very positive. Maker synergy.

* Pro - 
* Basic - use of public spaces and tools. Not harsh about overnight storage, just can’t be entitled to the space. 
* Waivers - assumed risk
* Roughly break even right now.
* People have been reaching out for tours. We’re on the Seattle Maker database for folks looking for space. Tours staffed on Sundays. Garage door open and sandwich board out.
* Gym membership - lots of people forget to cancel when they quit using. Some intentionally.
* Regular members can’t give code out or leave anyone unsupervised. Pro-members allowed one assistant.

Rules for using the space - http://www.altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/

## Challenges
* Growing created other problems. Not everyone knows everyone creates lack of accountability. Lack of staff, nobody’s job to take care of it. 
* Attrition and vacancy has been the issue. Use the space professionally and personally. 
* Spring cleaning, stuff accumulates. Had to up membership rates in the back space for storage. Defuckification events. Goodwill/dumptruck/art run. 
* Personal tools in communal space. Upset when people used them. If you leave it on a common space, it gets used.
* Kicking someone out? Management team votes and delegate talks to them - self selected pro members who show up and care, investment in the space. Only about 3-4 total with hundreds here. Once info shared and we have complaints haven’t had issues with agreement. Clear guidelines. Wasn’t ultimately a surprise to him. He’d been informed several times. 
* Min age 14 with parent, 16 without. Hasn’t been an issue but one teenager whose parent was a member came in to drink. 

## Other
* Relationship with Coyote space. They let us use the courtyard.
* Painter used to have workshops for at-risk youth. Too many people in too small a space. Liability consideration in 
* Small income stream of Seattle Poly meetup. Suggested donations ends up 50-60 per week. Takes over the space and prevents other usage. Probably not worth it. 
* Lots of freedom to make improvements/additions. E.g. unique keycode access.
* Gate entry for meetings is handy to leave open rather than garage space access.
* Signage - questions with Ron - smaller signs and placards. Probably wouldn’t have a problem. Get approval from city of seattle first.
* Some of the garage neighbors are cool. Has a community feel. 

## Lessons Learned
  * Well crafted mission statements and values are critical
  * Explicit organizing documents that codify decision making processes are critical, as is a framework for updating those rules
  * Come and go memberships don't really work. People aren't invested in the space, don't make it better, and (depending on the person) trash shared infrastructure. If this is a model for the space you're thinking about moving forward, I highly recommend a more onerous tool / space use process. Probably even better are 6-12 month membership plans.
