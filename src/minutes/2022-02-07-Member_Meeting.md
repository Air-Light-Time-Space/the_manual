Big thanks to Andrew, Ankur, Benjamin, Kevin, Scott, Vera & Esther for attending the meeting last night!

The property search continues. It sounds like we missed the boat on the place we were looking at in SODO, but we are 2nd on the waiting list if their current prospect falls through.

Andrew set up a google sheet to track the options that have come up: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lHkda-J2jZ8jx5hdVO1AKToYczkEJN-Nzj4hSiAxrxc/edit#gid=0

Kevin and Benjamin will reach out to Equinox Studios in Georgetown to see if there's a possibility of us finding room there.

Timeline wise we decided if we don't have a new space set up by the beginning of May we'll start winding the space down. We have till June 1st to move out, but we can move out sooner if we get our act together.

If you know of any good commercial real estate or have a commercial real estate broker you've worked with before you should use Andrew's spreadsheet and coordinate in the #locations discord channel. If you want to apply to a place and there's a reasonable application fee the space will reimburse that.

In other news, the Local Connectivity Lab is looking for technically aware volunteers who can help them as they expand their 4g and wifi community network. They need volunteers who can troubleshoot technical problems and help them onboard new clients. If you're interested, get in touch with Esther at the LCL!

Thanks everyone!
