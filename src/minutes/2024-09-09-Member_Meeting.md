## Agenda

### ‚ö°Ô∏èAll outlets in The Metal Shop are LIVE‚ö°Ô∏è

So be careful.

Shout out to Matt McKenzie and Chuck for splitting the 240v into the woodshop for the new planer/joiner.

There is a junction box for this 240v circuit, which is where the circuit is
likely to blow if overloaded.

Please let people know if you flip this breaker - if it's blowing all the time,
we should address it.

### üöß WIP: upstairs floor outlets

Matt Stuart is planning to run circuit C up to the electrical outlets, also ethernet and compressed air.

### Ian wants to run a compressed air line and hose reel into the metal shop.

Members in attendance approved of the expense.

### Hot Permits

Matt Chang has put payment in the mail.

Our permit limits the number of machines in the space, this includes welding machines and the plasma cutter (but apparently not oxyacetylene).

Michael (notetaker) forgot which machines we proposed having in the space.

### Plasma Cutter: The Next Chapter

The plasma cutter at altspace belongs to Noah. It's a CNC with a powerful
cutting head. In theory you can do really cool stuff with it, but it's been out of
commission for a long time.

In the meanwhile, it's very big and takes up valuable space in the metal shop.

Recently some folks (at least Chuck, Ian, and Lucas, though maybe others) have
been working on restoring it and have made some progress, but more work
remains.

At the meeting (which Ian and Lucas attended, but neither Chuck nor Noah were able to make it), we discussing replacing the plasma cutter with something functioning and more right sized to the space.

Our best guess of an ideal shape would be something more like a 4'x8' table (vs. the current one which is more like 8'x8' (approx?)).

Stage 1: Replace the current plasma table with a working hand held plasma cutter. This has utility on it's own.
Stage 2: Get a CNC to which you can mount the handheld plasma cutter.

We'd want to make sure the stage 1 handheld cutter we purchase is compatible as a CNC cutting head, but Ian and Will confirmed that this is a common and doable thing.

Michael and Ian are going to collaborate on a more specific hardward and implementation proposal for the next meeting. Reach out if you're interested!

### Greg: There's some semi-abandoned things here. What should we do?

We didn't come up with any real conclusions on a new policy, but re-iterated the existing policy:

If you do not label your property, it becomes communal property.
If you don't want people to touch your stuff, it needs to be labeled with Red tape.
If you want to store private property at the space for more than a few days, you need to do so in your dedicated storage area - either by using tub storage or a pro space (reach out to Space Manager, Matt Change for details).

### Greg: Is shopping around the idea of a regional "makerspace exchange"

Something like, getting together regional makerspaces, and for an extra fee, existing members at one space can use other spaces in the area - certain places may have tools for certain tasks that you only need once in a while. We can all benefit from eachother in this way, at a seemingly marginal expense.

The specifics are still being worked out, but everybody at the meeting thought this seemed like a great direction.
