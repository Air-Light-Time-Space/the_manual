Jaime, Dillon - other maker spaces in town history, John member for 4 years, Noah member helping manage

Backup plan for people without smartphones for access. Smartcard access sidesteps smartphone. Could have tech problems. Hotel access card registered. Must be manually maintained. Internet access problems. 
* Does it callout?
* Keycard is more tried and tested tech. Backup/override
* Code on garages as failsafe - change and share with more select group. 

Have some cameras that need set up

Volunteer commitments for access

* Had classes and regular events
* 50/mo fee, full scholarship come in 2x/mo to take out trash
* Assess task list - Noah
  * Trash, clean towels, Instructions posted for everything
  * Be around on a schedule to give tours, sign people up
  * Sweeping
* Area host approach - Dillon in Chicago with hundreds of members. Each shop had a PIC. People would compete to be the one in charge of that space bc it gave ownership and a person who you had a connection to.
* Bounty of a month’s membership to do specific projects that fell outside of normal

Official “no-fly” list - maker community has some known bad entities.

* Collette has documentation on decisions made.
* How does banned from altspace interact with ban from 
* One person on list was banned from Attic and generally considered to be fine with community but made problem in the space, saying feminism was interfering with his existence. Annoying but not necessarily enough to be banned from events.
* Clear that we have ability to assess and plan
* Perceptively awkward v. pushing too much, not going to learn
* Nice not to have to do in context of the space.
* Negative behavior flees to the shadows when positive culture and community are fostered. 
* 
Need communication about what could be left. Intermix pro and casual members, part of the community encouragement. Public computer area.

Painting event - 

Business Model
* Semi-pro space for a week with any available space for a week.
* Bins could be ala cart - same rate
* Kick extra in for storage as the chanel for premium, create gradient up to pro by square footage. Representative of load on the space.
* Returns on charging extra for the metal shop may not be 
* Largest, most flexible fluid memberships have the most money. Imagining the use of the metal shop is a big marketing draw.
* People might group projects. Open the endless predictable stream of cash.
* Storage is the easiest way to rachet up. Flexibility/impulsivity - log into your account and increase your rate quickly. Passive upgrade by claiming a crate. Lowest friction, people have inertia.

Maker Bar in NJ - regular meetup group. Programming night, soldering night, prefab kits.

Scholarships host a class.

Free month for offering a class where attendees pay. Covers their membership. 

Donation based day use breakdown.

,*David needs to make website handoff.

* Low barrier to entry and not painful if i don’t exit.
* BM wholly owned subsidiary model. Could be entirely independent. Which model are we selecting and why?
* Rent pro-space as a group
* Volunteers staff from 9am-9pm weekdays, 10am - 10pm weekends, 6hr shift for access
* Rejected walk-in day use for lack of a manager ($10 donation)
* Balance of pro-space in back for meetings, potlucks, project storage.
* 300/mo pro, $75 access and bins
* Metal shop users should pay a little more. Consumables, insurance, permitting.
* Ask the members who used the space
* 19 pro members would pay the rent, 16 would be optimal
  * Currently 5 pro spaces, 
* How much is it worth to Ignition - 
* Open community access with suggested donation during business hours, 24/7 access for monthly rate
* Additional rate for metal shop
* Incentive for longer term membership

Alternatives:
* Hiawatha Art Space = $3,200/mo base rent, available end of Sept
* Equinox - how do they lease?
* existing makers space we pay for access - explored but not feasible.
* Hybrid model - continuing current operation but adding Ignition membership.
  * Conversion process
* Free for everyone. We assume costs and supported by all INW membership “dues”. 
* Segregated funds building for purchase.

Setup
* Dirtiness gradient v. time of day use
* Possibly move sewing area to back. 
* Semi walls
