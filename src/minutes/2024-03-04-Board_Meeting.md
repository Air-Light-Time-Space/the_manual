Meeting is called to order at 7:30p, following a brief intermission after the monthly member meeting.

This meeting is a continuation of the annual board meeting, pushed from Feb 4th in order to give the membership full notice of incoming board nominations.

Greg has been examining altspace finanancials as prepared by outgoing treasurer Andrew.

We discuss the new board nominees, the only nominee in attendance is Greg Lucas who has been a member of the space since August 2023.

Ironically we failed to take any confirming votes during the preceeding member meeting, but since the current attendees made up the majority vote of the preceeding meeting we decided to take a confirming vote for Greg since he was there.
*(Addendum: We later tracked down Daniel, a recently-joined member who had attended the earlier meeting and since retired to operating his forge on the loading dock and he confirmed his support of Greg for a board seat.)

Noah makes a motion to confirm Greg to the ALTSpace board:
* Matthew votes yes
* Noah votes yes
* Andrew votes yes
* Kevin votes yes

Greg Lucas is confirmed as a member of the board.

Since no other board nominees are in attendance we decide to move on.

Andrew informs us that there is a surprise guest at the meeting. Andrew (who is appearing remotely) pans his camera out and Michael Kirk is seen to be sitting on the same couch.

We welcome Michael to the meeting and Noah makes another motion to confirm Michael to the ALTSpace board:
* Matthew votes yes
* Noah votes yes
* Andrew votes yes
* Kevin votes yes
* Greg votes yes
* Michael votes yes

Michael Kirk is confirmed as a member of the board.

Greg asks for access to the financials worksheet from Andrew and gives Andrew his email address.

There is some discussion about new officer rolls and it is taken to a vote:

Greg to President?
Passes with 6 votes.

Michael to Secretary?
Passes with 6 votes.

Matthew to Treasurer?
Passes with 6 votes.

Andrew mentions a small error we made on our IRS reporting for 2022, he says he will look into what is needed to correct this, if necessary.

Matthew brings up B&O insurance and there is general agreement that he should look into it.

Matthew also would like to talk to a non-profit consultant and has someone in mind who might offer us a couple hours for free or might charge for more advice. Matthew is given the go-ahead to look further into this as well.

Matthew makes a motion to schedule another board meeting for the first Monday in June (2024-06-03) at 7:30p (following the member meeting) to discuss the results of his investigation and changes to the bylaws.
The motion passes unanimously.

Meeting is called to close at 7:50p
