Hey there ALTSpacers,

Thanks to those who attended the meeting last night. We decided we could probably soft-open the space again with a few rules. Here's how it's gonna work:

* Pre-schedule your usage of the space in one-hour blocks on the [ALTSpace calendar](http://www.altspaceseattle.com/calendar). Put your name and the area you want to use in the title of the event (e.g. "Noah is using the Wood shop"). The areas are Metal shop, Wood shop, Main space.
* One person per area at a time. Make sure not to overlap an existing schedule. First come first served! If there is a conflict try to get in touch with the person and work it out.
* Pro members can come into the Main space while someone else is working there, practice appropriate social distancing measures. Pro members should still schedule use of the garage-shops.
* If you don't yet have the new code contact me and I will tell you. I will keep a list of those who've requested access to the space in case we need to do contact tracing at some point :o
* Sanitize tools before putting them away
* We're not going to share dust masks. I've temporarily removed the dust masks from the shops. For other safety gear (gloves, safety glasses, etc) consider bringing your own. If you do use ones from the space sanitize them before and after use.
* Consider wearing gloves and a mask while you use the space
* Wash your hands during and after use of the space

Anything else you want to add to the list? Discuss it here.

The space has *some* sanitizing supplies, some clorox wipes, some hand sanitizer, alcohol, bleach, etc. but could use more. If you have extra supplies you don't need please consider bringing them with you and donating them to the space.

There was some concern expressed during the meeting that some people might pull childish stunts like changing other people's scheduled calendar entries or booking up 10 hours every day and coming in at their leisure. I'm hoping we're all above that sort of thing, but at the meeting we agreed this is probably grounds for kicking you out, so play fair and give people the benefit of the doubt.

I will be working on organizing the supplies closet for the next week or so, so please pardon the chaos towards the front of the main space.

Thanks and stay healthy!
