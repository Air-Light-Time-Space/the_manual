Meeting started immediately following the monthly members meeting for November, around 7:00pm.

Andrew called this meeting to pass some bylaws and discuss other compliance requirements for the organization.

Draft bylaws previously written by Noah are discussed and Matthew proposes passing as is to gain compliance then revisiting with more edits and changes at the next annual board meeting.

Noah suggests implementing a couple previously discussed quick fixes, namely striking language mentioning our prior sponsors, Ignition Northwest, and the individual board member spending limit (which was arbitrarily set to $500).

Regarding the spending limit, Greg inquires as to our current average spending, we reviewed the spending worksheet and Matthew informed us he spends < $500/mo and usually batches his expenses.

In a brief diversion Andrew informs us of outstanding balances owed to members: Matthew - $1522.50, Andrew - $380, Michael - $360

Taken to a vote:

Strike references to Ignition Northwest from the bylaws? - **4 votes in favor**

Keep $500 spending limit as is? - **3 votes in favor** (Matthew abstains)

Noah moves to pass bylaws with agreed changes - **4 votes in favor**

Bylaws must be published for legal compliance, Matthew proposes freezing them to PDF and putting on website. Noah agrees to work on this.

Andrew informs us of our requirement to furnish the state of Washington with yearly social purpose reports and asks for a review of some reports he’s written. No specific vote was taken, but outlook was favorable. Andrew will file what he’s got.

Noah asks where people want to keep a running log of board decisions as required in the new bylaws. Andrew proposes google sheets and it is unanimously agreed.

Matthew asks if our vote is enough to make the new bylaws binding, Noah reasons that power to enact initial bylaws ultimately comes from the organizations incorporators which are Noah Tippett and Ben Tramposh, and since Ben has left the board this is probably binding.

Someone asks if we have to send our bylaws to the state and none of us know.

Noah wonders if we have to send meeting minutes to the state. No one knows this either.

Meeting is concluded around 7:13pm
