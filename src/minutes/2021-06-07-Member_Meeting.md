Hello All,

At today's monthly member's meeting a panel consisting of Michael, Marshall, Dan, and I all approved the relaxed COVID-19 guidelines as proposed by Noah on this mailing list. Ill include them below.

* **More than one person per shop now allowed**
* **Continue using the calendar for scheduling so that we can contact trace if a spreading event happens**
* **Wear masks if more than one person is in the space**

If you prefer operating under stricter or more relaxed guidelines please attend the next monthly members meeting. If you have any concerns or accessibility needs that are precluded by these guidelines please let us all know so that we can accommodate you. 

Thanks,
Aidan
