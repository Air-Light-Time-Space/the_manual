## Happenings

Ian has been working with the 3d printer and was unable to connect to it on the documented http://cr10.local.
Turning it off and back on again seemed to get it back online, but he hasn't had a chance to try printing anything yet.

Ian brought his metal chop saw and his grinding wheel into the metal shop. Thanks Ian!

The plasma cutter is online! Noah and Ian made a little test spiral after some chores replacing the control station monitor and keyboard.

Matthew McKenzie has been making steady progress on the railings around the upper mezzanine and work area. Godspeed Matthew.

Matthew McKenzie discussed the upcoming open house event we'll be tabling at Equinox. The hope is to let people know we exist and maybe draw in some new members.
He'll share a post and solicit volunteers on discord soon.

It was noted that new board selection will take place at the next board meeting in January. Greg is thinking about joining the board.
In accordance with the bylaws, the new board members will be confirmed at the general membership at a subsequent regular member meeting.

Greg wants to look into corporate sponsorships for altspace - e.g. for materials.

Greg wants to connect with other maker spaces to learn about how they approach corporate sponsorship. Godspeed Greg.

Rob expressed interest in working on the railing (and maybe small stairs!) for the lower mezzanine. Godspeed Rob.

Metalshop materials storage could use some attention from people who use the metalshop. Ian expressed interest in shepherding this. Godspeed Ian.
