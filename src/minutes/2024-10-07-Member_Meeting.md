## Agenda

### üí• Dan lead a discussion about better safety of the OXY-Acetylene rig in the metalshop.

It's one of the more dangerous tools in the shop.

We talked about storage and usage. Alternatives discussed included keeping it under lock and key, mandatory certification, or a lighter protocol based approach.

Ultimately, we decided on an approach leveraging the existing systems at altspace:

- üë∑ TODO: Al is going to yellow tape the Oxy-Acetylene with his phone number. That means you cannot use oxy acetylene at altspace until you get an initial confirmation from Al, who will make sure you understand the do's and don'ts

- üë∑ TODONE: Dan relocated the rig to a dedicated corner of the metalshop, where it should be returned to whenever you're done using it.

### Replacing non-functioning plasma cutter CNC with a plasma cutting hand torch (30min proposal)

Original Proposal: <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hIySHSzWGPEO67aOeffXKIcqr-qNfW-MAfkrMV9yj0A/edit>

The plasma cutter CNC in the metalshop hasn't functioned in several years and is taking up a lot of space that could be used for more basic metalshop needs.

Noah confirmed that he is the owner of the whole setup, including the table, machine, and torch. He bought it from a friend, and had a dream of configuring it to be a modular all purpose CNC for plasma, water jetting, wood milling, you name it. But life happened, and Noah has been too busy to push that dream forward for a while.

In the meanwhile, the metal shop has gotten busier over the last few years. Members at this meeting (and the Sept. meeting) expressed an interest in freeing up the space. A recurring theme expressed from active metalshop users was to reclaim that space for more "basic" tools (examples given: bolted down grinding station, hand drills with functioning bits, drill press, sheet metal break, band saw).

‚úÖ We voted to get rid of the current table and machine (vote tally at least 4 in favor, 2 opposed, and several stand asides).

There was broad support for getting a hand torch plasma cutter that could one day be modified for CNC purposes. We didn't take a vote on that, but even the people who wanted to keep the old CNC supported getting a hand-held setup.

No specific space funding was allocated for buying a new plasma cutter at this meeting, but the treasurer (Matt McKenzie) confirmed we're currently operating at a healthy surplus, and the space can probably afford to help by tools while still building our nest egg.

### Next steps

 - üë∑ TODO: Help Noah remove the old machine.
 - üë∑ TODO: Hone in on the exact plasma cutter / specs we want - Ian suggested one in the initial proposal, Al had a potential alternative in mind.
 - üë∑ TODO: Start fundraising from members (like we have with the joiner, planer, drop saw) for a new plasma cutter.

It's probable that the space can match some portion of the funds if there appears to be member support, but we'll have to talk about it at the next meeting assuming it's more than an individual board member's discretionary budget ($200).

### Rahul gave an update on our missing Discord owner

Ava set up our discord chat, but is no longer active at the space and apparently no longer has access to her discord account which owns the altspace discord channel.

Does anyone else have admin access?

Rahul is going to look into how to recover a Discord server.

### Matthew: Plans to spend some money on the woodshop

There are some projects in the work - notably ventilation and dust collection
that will greatly improve the utility and comfort of the woodshop.

Stay tuned for some financial asks in pursuit of these goals.
