Many thanks to Greg, Benjamin, Matt C, Matthew M, Kevin, Andrew and Rob for attending our monthly meeting last night!

Greg told us our request for free ad spend from google was denied by robots, but he appealed and now we're on a 90 day human-review clock.

We talked about some random leaks around the space (it's been raining hard the last few days). Most of them were deemed to be minor, but Andrew agreed to investigate some newer vent work.

Fun projects were discussed:

 *   We need to build a railing around the unsafe bits of the storage mezzanine, no one volunteered to do this at the meeting, if you're interested then let us know!


 *   We need a door to the air compressor space. Noah agreed to investigate sliding hardware to deploy our extra wooden door in this manner.


Matthew mentioned that we are Equinox's artist/studio of the month (see: http://equinoxstudios.org/) They will be promoting us all month long on their social media and Matthew has proposed the following dates for open houses:

Thursday November 16, open house from 6-8pm
Thursday November 30, open house from 6-8pm

If you are available at these times consider dropping by the space to hang out and chat with people!

Andrew went over our financials: our revenue from member dues is around $4600/mo, this month we spent $5400, but that includes ~$1700 for insurance which lasts the whole year, so we are currently solvent. Andrew informs us we have about $8500 in the bank. Andrew also informs us we hit 76 members which is an all time high!

Thanks to everyone who keeps the space ticking, we'll talk again next month.
