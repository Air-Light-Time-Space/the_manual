<p>Day-to-day management of the space can be performed on an ad-hoc basis
by anyone who has the time and understands the problem. If you notice
something that needs to be done, perhaps you would be a good person to
do it. If you don't know how to do something ask someone who has done
it before, then add the information to this wiki!</p>
<p>Access to sensitive information (accounts, credentials, keys, etc) is
available on a need-to-know basis. If you need to know, ask around and
someone will tell you.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of members should only be
shared with directors of the board or agents duly authorized by the
board to handle such data.</p>
<p>If you have time and you love the space consider stepping up to help
keep the place running. By managing the space collectively we ensure
the needs of the space can adapt to changes in membership or conditions
on the ground.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="electrical"><a class="header" href="#electrical">Electrical</a></h1>
<p>üö® The building is currently under heavy renovation, so the details here are
likely to change.</p>
<p>Most of the main space and the metal shop are wired into the &quot;High Voltage&quot;
closet in the main space. This door is locked to slow down modifications from
cavalier hackers (apparently this has been an issue in the past). If a circuit
blows, ask around and you can probably find a way in to get it reset.</p>
<h2 id="woodshop"><a class="header" href="#woodshop">Woodshop</a></h2>
<p>The legacy wiring in the woodshop is prone to flipping the circuit breaker, especially when working with hard woods in the table saw or planer.</p>
<p>The woodshop and half of the garage east of the woodshop (Scott's shop) are
inexplicably wired to a breaker that lives way over yonder in the eastern most
garage. Scott's shop also has a new separate dedicated run. Allegedly all the
garages will get their own dedicated circuits run as part of the ongoing
renovation before too long.ü§û</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, gain access to the eastern most garage and reset the woodshop breaker. 
It's actually two switches, joined together with a metal collar (see photo below).</p>
<p>When the switch is blown you'll first have to push them all the way off to reset, and then back on.</p>
<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/217057/144557821-f49f121e-3d2a-4631-b7c4-cc4104205297.jpg" alt="IMG_2610_copy" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bi-yearly-air-compressor-servicing"><a class="header" href="#bi-yearly-air-compressor-servicing">Bi-yearly Air Compressor Servicing</a></h1>
<p>Several compressed air lines run through the space. The compressor lives under
the stairs in the west alley, accessible from the back door in the main space.</p>
<p>It's good to check the compressor every 6 months or so to make sure it has oil.
There is a reminder to do this on the shared calendar. It's good to take a look
in the compressor room every so often more regularly than that to make sure there
are no problems.</p>
<p>On the east wall of the compressor room there is a grey metal switch box with a 
switch you can use to turn the compressor on and off. Always turn it off before
any kind of servicing. The compressor has a large exposed belt and spinning wheel
and can start suddenly at any time if not disabled. When working on or near the
compressor, put a ziptie or small padlock into the cover of the switch with a note
attached containing your name and contact info. This should help ensure no one
turns the compressor back on while it's in a compromised state.</p>
<p>The compressor room also has a fire extinguisher on the west wall, as well as an
office-style clip light you can reach for in the dark to illuminate the situation.</p>
<p>The large green thing in that room is an air drying unit, use it if you need the
air in the lines to be extra dry, but turn it off when you are done using it. The
tank under the compressor also has a timed discharge port at the back that discharges
any collected condensation on a regular interval (as long as it remains plugged in
and the outlet's protection switch hasn't tripped).</p>

have an up to date fire permit - it's a piece of paper hanging in the metal
shop, that must be renewed annually.</p>
<p><img src="images/fire_permit.jpg" alt="fire permit in the metalshop" /></p>
<p>As part of the permitting process, an inspector will stop by unannounced,
usually 1-2 months after the permit is renewed. Among other things, they'll be
verifying that our fire extinguishers have had their annual service. We
typically do them at the same time as the permit, but you can check the tag on
each fire extinguisher in the space to be sure.</p>
<p><img src="images/fire_extinguisher.jpg" alt="fire extinguisher" /></p>
<p>The inspection helps make sure our space is operating safely, and also puts us
on file with the fire department, so that in case there ever <em>is</em> a fire here,
they'll know to respond based on the specific equipment and chemicals we have.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="first-aid-supplies"><a class="header" href="#first-aid-supplies">First Aid Supplies</a></h1>
<p>There is a larger first aid box in the main space with smaller ones in woodshop
and metalshop.</p>
<p>Each should contain (at a minimum):</p>
<ul>
<li>disposable sanitary gloves</li>
<li>antiseptic wipes</li>
<li>various sizes of bandaids</li>
<li>antibiotic ointment</li>
<li>ziplock bag and chemical cold pack in case of amputation üò¨</li>
<li>disposable splinter picker</li>
<li>knuckle bandages</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally the larger box in the main space should have: </p>
<ul>
<li>NSAID like acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen</li>
<li>eye-wash</li>
<li>medical tape and gauze for when band-aids won't suffice</li>
<li>butterfly/wound clamping bandages: e.g. 3M Steri Strip Skin Closures 1/4&quot; X 3&quot;</li>

<p>Any current member can onboard a new member to the space.</p>
<p>Make sure that the new member:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has filled out a <a href="waivers.html">waiver</a></li>
<li>Has read and understands the <a href="https://altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/">rules of the space</a></li>
<li>Has made at least one payment of membership dues by cash, check, or paypal</li>
</ul>
<p>If all of the above is true, you can tell them the codes and welcome them to the space! Have them send an email to the space manager to get an invitation to the mailing list and shared calendar.</p>
<p>Blank waivers can be found in the filing cabinet just to your right as you walk in the keypad door. Completed waivers can be left in the cash deposit box (on that same wall next to the first aid kit).</p>
<h2 id="communication-channels"><a class="header" href="#communication-channels">Communication channels</a></h2>
<p>Currently, most day to day chatter is on our <a href="https://discord.com/channels/834243114339401759/834243243989663744">Discord chat

<p>There is also the <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/altspace-seattle">altspace-seattle

<p>We use a shared google calendar to coordinate sharing high demand resources like the woodshop. You're welcome to stop by without a reservation, but if someone already has it reserved, they get priority. Ensure that your fellow members have fair opportunities to use the space by making your reservations not too frequent or long.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="liability-waivers"><a class="header" href="#liability-waivers">Liability Waivers</a></h1>
<p><strong>ALL</strong> users of the space must complete and sign a
<a href="https://altspaceseattle.com/ALTSpace_Liability_Waiver.pdf">Liability Waiver</a>
before making use of any of the tools or amenities at the space.</p>
<p>If you bring a guest into the space make sure they fill out a
waiver before they use any tools, or even if they're just going
to be hanging out for awhile.</p>
<p>Completed waivers are kept in the black safe near the side exit and are organized
into a number of folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pro</em> - All currently active Pro members</li>
<li><em>Basic</em> - All currently active Basic members</li>
<li><em>Supporter</em> - All currently active Supporter members</li>
<li><em>Potential</em> - People who filled out a waiver but haven't signed up yet.
-- It's good to go through these every now and again and shred the ones
that are really old. If our membership is low, you can reach out to these
people before shredding their PII and ask if they're still interested in signing up.</li>
<li><em>Previous users</em> - Not really a folder, but a large stack of previous members/
users of the space, sorted reverse chronologically</li>
<li><em>Possibly not</em> - Waivers of previous users who we may not want to allow to
rejoin the space for whatever reason. Write notes on the back of the waiver.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a waiver you need to file but you don't know the code to the safe,
you can fold it in half and stick it in the cash payments box near the first
aid kit.</p>

<p>Noah successfully filed last three years of federal taxes.</p>
<p>We may be liable for a fine for the filing delays, but Noah requested an exemption.
Noah mentioned <em>worst case</em> would be something like $10/day up to $10k, but given we're such a small organization that seems unlikely.</p>
<p>(https://www.irs.gov/payments/failure-to-file-penalty says the max penalty is 25% of your taxes, so it seems like it'd be much less than that if they decide to fine at all)</p>

<p>We used to have a stable link to our video conference / virtual meeting at aloha.altspaceseattle.com. It's currently broken so we've been using an adhoc solution in the meanwhile. Michael may have broken it while updating our website ssl (sorry!).</p>
<p>It's partially a custom piece of software written by Noah.</p>

<p>Maxx has a 48&quot;x32&quot;ish workbench on wheels and offered to donate it. We thought it was a good idea. Noah is going to provide a truck and they're going to move it into the space this weekend.</p>

<p>We were recently donated a bunch of tools and desktop PC's (like 18?).
Some are being, or will be, put to good use around the space, but we're unlikely to utilize all of them.</p>
<p>Michael thinks we should sell the remainder.
No concerns raised by the group, but it was noted we could probably get more money selling them individually vs. taking the entire lot to e.g. RE-PC.
Though it might make sense to offer a bulk discount.</p>
<ul>
<li>üë∑ TODO Michael: Post some computers on craiglist/offerup/w.e.</li>

<p>Just dial 1-87-SPACE-ALTS!</p>
<p>Michael was surprised when the phone in the space rang and answered it and it was a real person calling for a tour. Apparently Dan fixed the phone recently. Thanks Dan!</p>
<p>Long ago (at the cherry st. location?) there used to be a failover, so if no one answered the phone, it'd roll over to a members cell phone, but that no longer seems to be in place.
We could set that up again, but no one stepped up to bottom line this.</p>

<p>Matt wants to set up a pottery station with our potters wheel.
It might be especially good for people who can't operate within Seattle Artist League's hours.

<h2 id="maxx-is-concerned-about-dust-upstairs"><a class="header" href="#maxx-is-concerned-about-dust-upstairs">Maxx: is concerned about dust upstairs.</a></h2>
<p>Maxx suggested hanging some sheets or other dividers.

<hr />
<h2 id="heat"><a class="header" href="#heat">Heat</a></h2>
<p>Val brought up the concern about the lack of heat.</p>
<p>Andrew: traced power from the heaters to the thermostat by the side door.
Looked like someone had previously pulled the thermostat out, but he didn't
want to mess with it further.</p>
<p>Val: Should the landlord take care of that? Is it in the lease? (lease is by
the side door)</p>
<p>(Any input from folks who are in the know is welcome)</p>
<h2 id="woodshop-1"><a class="header" href="#woodshop-1">Woodshop</a></h2>
<p>The woodshop is a very (the most?) busy desirable space right now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Longer term we can look into getting the north space back (if the numbers pan
out, it would require a capitol investment), or consider alternative spaces,
but in the immediate term we have ratified the following proposal:</li>
</ul>
<p>Ankur: (via noah) there <em>was</em> some incentive in renting north and south space
together from landlord since north space can be accessed from south space.</p>
<p>Ankur: Having front facing space is good advertising.</p>
<p>Aidan: garage front is nice. We have some duplicate tools, maybe even having
two woodshop spaces is doable.  Let's take account after new insurance is due,
since there might be ramifications.</p>
<p>Ankur: biggest bottleneck is access to tablesaw. When scheduleing - indicate if
you‚Äôre open to sharing the space or if you want the entire shop. do you need:
table saw, cross cut saw, assembly</p>
<p>Bryan: proposed maybe there be some kind of per-member hours budget</p>
<p>Ankur: maybe that will discourage new members...</p>
<h3 id="calendaring-proposal"><a class="header" href="#calendaring-proposal">Calendaring Proposal</a></h3>
<p>When reserving time on the shared calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Members are asked to include contact information on their bookings
on the calendar so that multiple people using the space can be negotiated.</li>
<li>Members should limit schedule bookings to 4 hours maximum and will lose
priority if more than 15 minutes late to their booking.</li>

who is interested in it. We are working on having it extracted.</li>

8 members attended and noted the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Val will be in charge of the scholarship program</li>
<li>Heat in altspace is not yet a thing as the base heaters are broken. People bringing in space heaters is welcome but risky if someone leaves theirs on.</li>
<li>Michael will set up a temperature probe</li>
<li>Membership meetings should stay primarily virtual even beyond the pandemic because that is easiest for the membership who are scattered across the state and more. A proposal may be made to create a better tech solution to have a hybrid virtual and in person approach in the space. </li>
<li>A whitelist of common supplies should be solicited from the membership of which any member can purchase an amount of for the space and be reimbursed by the treasurer without needing a vote at a membership meeting</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the 8 present members voted on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unanimous vote to discard the vending machine. Michael will put it on craigslist</li>
<li>Unanimous vote to approve a 500 dollar investment in putting an antenna on top of altspace for Open Connectivity Lab</li>
<li>Unanimous vote to approve up to 500 dollars in networking equipment for Edward to use in setting up a network at altspace</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics including Calendly integrations and woodshop conflicts were punted to the next meeting as affected members were not present.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Michael Kirk and Edward for committing to follow up on several points voted on by membership present at the meeting.</p>

<p>Hello All,
Just a reminder:
Our monthly member meetings are held every first Monday of the month at 6:30 on Jitsi. The link to join is always posted here and in the discord.... save for this Monday evidently. In the future, the email notifications will be automated and the link will be static. The meetings are a time where any member at basic level or higher can propose purchases of new tools or parts, changes to rules, or raise any concerns they may have about the space. The vast majority of decisions affecting the maker space are made at these meetings democratically by the attending members.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of today's meeting:
3 attending member came to a full consensus on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>follow up with Val and see how the sewing machines need servicing. Altspace budget should be used for any parts or services needed</li>
<li>thread should be acquired for all sewing machines</li>
<li>a new iron should be acquired for the sewing area</li>
<li>our current iron should be discarded</li>
<li>Marshall is authorized to place flytraps around the space</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the following comments were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>folks need to be cleaning up after themselves. Some amount of custodial work is not yet happening. This may also fit into our current scholarship options for folks seeking less expensive basic memberships</li>
<li>we should investigate the band saw. It is not able to cut through wood or aluminum anymore. Unsure if repairs or replacement are needed. If any member can take a look and post their findings here or in the discord that would be wonderful!</li>
<li>we should look into having stewards for each area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendees:</p>
<ul>
<li>Noah Tippett</li>
<li>Vera Ranguelova</li>
<li>Aiden Hahn</li>
<li>Mars Saxman</li>
</ul>
<p>Agenda: </p>
<h2 id="officers"><a class="header" href="#officers">Officers</a></h2>
<p>Noah mentioned that there are 5 members of the board and we need 4 officers, so he‚Äôs hoping each person can step up to be an officer. There are: President, Vice president, Treasurer, Secretary. </p>
<p>President
Vice President
Treasurer
Secretary</p>
<h2 id="noah-has-been-and-what-is-needed-for-altspace-to-function"><a class="header" href="#noah-has-been-and-what-is-needed-for-altspace-to-function">Noah has been, and what is needed for Altspace to function</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Filing paperwork with the state and federal government for taxes etc</li>
<li>Onboard new members, give tours (others can and have been helping w ith this)</li>
<li>Makes sure all of our stuff like fire extinguishers are in compliance (needs tobe done but not necessarily by an officer)</li>
<li>Takes out trash and cleans up space</li>
<li>Keeps track of all paperwork like secretary, though not as officially as one might ‚Äì could be nice to have filing cabinet in the space</li>
<li>Has credit card for space and can buy stuff</li>
<li>Keeps track of bank accounts ‚Äì more people can be added with different limits, so can make this more complicated as needed.</li>
<li>Making decisions to keep Altspace functioning ‚Äì trying to do this with as much feedback and input as he can. </li>
<li>Proposing bylaws and changes to Altspace</li>
</ul>
<p>Aiden asked whether there is something that fits in with what he‚Äôs been doing for the space ‚Äì hosting meetings and giving tours is something he‚Äôs been doing. What would fit with officer position? 
Noah said this could be President/Vice president for officer, though anyone could be giving tours. Some member of the board should be at each members meeting so this could also fit with your interests. Aiden then said he understands Board; do all officers need to be elected today? An alternative might be to elect people who are willing today, but also could recruit officers at members meeting. </p>
<p>Noah said we need bylaws officially voted on by the end of Sept. filing deadline. We might need officers by the time we file those bylaws. You commitment would be only til January if you‚Äôre anything but the Vice President, who becomes President the next year. Noah imagines recruiting for the board in fall, then each officer chooses their successor in January. </p>
<p>Vera asked if someone needs to leave the board for any reason, what do they do? Noah mentioned this is in the bylaws: Can write letter to the board, Can stop paying dues and leave (automatic departure). Then the board will do a special meeting to select a new officer in that spot. Also the members can remove a board member/officer, and this removal motion needs to propose a replacement. </p>
<p>Vera wants to know the &quot;job description&quot; for each officer role. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>President</strong> ‚Äì Makes sure everyone else is doing their job. Writes letters to the membership on how we‚Äôre doing.</li>
<li><strong>Vice President</strong> ‚Äì Learning how to be the President, steps in while P is on vacation. </li>
<li><strong>Secretary</strong> ‚Äì Take notes at meetings, create cohesive notation of all decisions we‚Äôve made at meetings or not at meetings (decided between board members), file paperwork with secretary of state to list directors, any other annual filings, keeping track of all of Altspace paperwork ‚Äì insurance, bank account, loan, list of members. Some of this could be electronic but that‚Äôs not designed yet. Default is paper.</li>
<li><strong>Treasurer</strong> ‚Äì In charge of accounts, files taxes (or makes sure they‚Äôre filed by accountant). Has access to bank account, gives access to others who need it, make sure use of money is in compliance with AltSpace needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aiden asked if list of current members would be gleaned from PayPal. Noah said actually he made a current list that‚Äôs in a Google Doc. Most people pay on PayPal, but some people pay cash or check, so those wouldn‚Äôt show up on PayPal. Noah has done the filing for this year.
<strong>Aiden volunteers to be secretary!</strong></p>
<p>Mars made a life decision and thinks he might need to exit the board. He bought a sailboat in North Carolina to fix up and live on! He still loves and wants to support AltSpace, but can‚Äôt really help after the end of October. He doesn‚Äôt know how we feel about that. Noah is happy for Mars to stay on the board even under those circumstances. Mars is happy to be connected to AltSpace, to help with disasters, but not able to be consistently available for meetings. Noah confirms that a non-officer board position would be a good fit for Mars. He mentions that that kind of position would be possible for Vera too. </p>
<p>Vera says treasurer too much for her but she could take on Vice President for now, though she‚Äôs not sure about automatically becoming President next year. </p>
<p>Noah says he can be president and Treasurer. And he could change bylaws to remove being Vice President. And discussed some other details.</p>
<p>So, officially: </p>
<ul>
<li>Noah will be Vice President and Treasurer</li>
<li>Vera will be President</li>
<li>Aiden is Secretary</li>
</ul>
<p>Vera is still interested in more detailed job descriptions, especially hers. 
Right now Noah is the shop manager, so if she sees things that are a problem she lets Noah know. 
The only real responsibility of the president is to roll a dice at meetings when there‚Äôs a tie. Otherwise it‚Äôs being the voice to the membership. 
Noah says her only job for now can be trying to make people sign up for the board.</p>
<p>Noah will contact Kevin, who missed the meeting today, to let him know about this. </p>
<p>Votes for officers: </p>
<ul>
<li>4/4 votes for Aiden as secretary</li>
<li>4/4 votes for Noah vice president </li>
<li>4/4 votes for Noah treasurer</li>
<li>4/4 votes for Vera president</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rates"><a class="header" href="#rates">Rates</a></h2>
<p>Noah proposes we make $250 the new rate for Pro membership ‚Äì 4/4 yes</p>
<p>Basic rate moved to $65 for voting? ‚Äì 4/4 yes</p>
<p>Vera says she thinks it could be a little more expensive than $50. Noah says he chose the $50 rate for Basic members because they were 2/3 of the membership and we didn‚Äôt have pros at beginning of COVID. Now we‚Äôre saying your $50/person</p>
<p>Keep supporter name your own price? 3 of 4 board members say Yes</p>
<h2 id="bylaws"><a class="header" href="#bylaws">Bylaws</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Bylaws proposed to membership? ‚Äì 4/4 yes
The bylaws are in email but once ratified these will be posted on our website. 
First 3 years, board members can make changes by 2/3 vote. After 3 years the membership needs to vote on changes to the bylaws.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="insurance"><a class="header" href="#insurance">Insurance</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Accept staying Insured ‚Äì 4/4 votes, yes</li>
<li>Extra liability personal board insurance ‚Äì 0/4 votes (though Vera seemed a little on the fence; can vote again in January)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="protocolsorganization"><a class="header" href="#protocolsorganization">Protocols/Organization</a></h2>
<p>****** is code of the safe at Altspace (bythe back door)
Membership list is in the safe. Pro member waivers are there. (Not as up-to-date as he‚Äôd like; Aiden might update)
Volunteers/Scholars are in there too, and Basic members.
Also in the safe: Gigantic stack of ‚Äúnot members but have waivers‚Äù. All previous member waivers are good for if they sue us or other purposes.
Also a list of members who we might want to not have as members ever again. No reasons mentioned there but there are notes in the Google Sheet. (Called ‚ÄúPossibly not‚Äù)
Potential member waivers ‚Äì filled out a waiver but never joined. He historically has kept them around for 3-4 months and went through to contact recent folks to see if they want to sign up. But then shred them after a while to protect their confidential information.</p>
<p>Other system is Pay Rent in Cash box. Noah was going to give keys to other board members. This box also holds keys to garages. </p>
<h2 id="oberon"><a class="header" href="#oberon">Oberon</a></h2>
<p>Has been in the space since he was kicked out. Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs been in the space since we changed the locks. Aiden says he‚Äôs not a problem right now; wait til he makes contact again. Aiden was worried about it because he wanted things from us. Noah said he needs to provide detailed list of what is his, and proof that it was his. He hasn‚Äôt provided that.</p>
<h2 id="other-notes"><a class="header" href="#other-notes">Other notes</a></h2>
<p>Vera wants to figure out where to electronically track our documents etc. </p>
<ul>
<li>INW had Google Drive and our stuff is on there.</li>
<li>Aiden doesn‚Äôt like Google and Noah happy to go away from it. </li>
<li>Vera is happy with Wave Accounting, and it‚Äôs free. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other agenda items?
<strong>Wet walls for winter?</strong> Vera asked if this will be a problem this year. Noah says he hopes that the renovations are good for this. Alternately, this is a courtyard overflow issue that Ron needs a french drain for. So we‚Äôd wait til after signing a new lease to ask for a solution to this. </p>
<p>Long-term, if Ron doesn‚Äôt kick us out but he seems iffy on Altspace, maybe we could buy the second <strong>Coyote Central lot</strong> from them. If Altspace dissolves for some reason, the assets currently go to INW. But if we bought their lot we could give assets to Coyote Central. </p>
<p>Long-term if we get kicked out, we could move elsewhere. We make money now. Noah recently made an address sign for Ron so maybe that gives us better relationship.</p>
<p>Mars says he‚Äôs impressed with the revenue. He hasn‚Äôt seen Altspace thrive quite so well. Noah says he doesn‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs done anything special but hopefully putting together the bylaws will help keep whatever we‚Äôre doing well, going.</p>
<p>Vera asked <strong>what‚Äôs going on with the north space.</strong> Noah said that we‚Äôre pulling 4,600 now. But we‚Äôd need 7,000 or 8,000 revenue to afford the back space too. And Ron would like to rent these spaces together. Noah would like to rent it with a buffer. We‚Äôre in ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù mode now though.</p>

<hr />
<p>Many thanks to Ankur, Aidan, Yossi, Marshall, Dan, and Kevin for making it to the meeting last night!</p>
<p>We voted 6/7 to buy the stuff in the linked proposal plus new air filters for the wen air handler in the main garage, a new fence for the miter saw in the wood shop, a raspberry pi for the delta 3d printer and a new mainboard for the  printrbot metal. With the battery deal Jason identified I think the total should still be around $1000. I will endeavor to start acquiring these things for us. If anyone has any ideas for which free power tools we should acquire with our batteries let me know, otherwise I will probably just get a couple more power drills.</p>
<p>We also discussed COVID restrictions and were all of the opinion that allowing guests back into the space at this point is probably not problematic. If you have any concerns about it please speak up, otherwise I think we should tentatively re-allow guests at this point and vote on a more in-depth re-opening plan at our next meeting on August 2nd.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for all your hard work!</p>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>At today's monthly member's meeting a panel consisting of Michael, Marshall, Dan, and I all approved the relaxed COVID-19 guidelines as proposed by Noah on this mailing list. Ill include them below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More than one person per shop now allowed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Continue using the calendar for scheduling so that we can contact trace if a spreading event happens</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wear masks if more than one person is in the space</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you prefer operating under stricter or more relaxed guidelines please attend the next monthly members meeting. If you have any concerns or accessibility needs that are precluded by these guidelines please let us all know so that we can accommodate you. </p>
<p>Thanks,
Aidan</p>

<hr />
<p>Thanks so much to Matthew, Aidan, Ben, Kevin, and Salt for joining this month's meeting, we had some very productive conversation and a lovely time.</p>
<p>We voted 6/6 to start using Jitsi for all future meetings, and even managed to transition the meeting to Jitsi partway through. There may be some slight logistical challenges setting up a permanent unchanging meeting URI, but several potential solutions were discussed. Stay tuned for further updates, our next meeting will be on Monday, June 7th.</p>
<p>We also confirmed the last-minute board nominations of both Aidan (6/6) and myself (5/6).</p>
<p>Other than that, we talked a bit about signage (we are waiting for construction before we start installing any new permanent signs, but Aidan is going to try pressure washing our name into the sidewalk).</p>
<p>We had some very fruitful discussion about bylaws and the mechanics of implementing a functional maker space. We're hoping to have a member-wide vote for the enacting of some bylaws possibly as early as our next meeting, so if you haven't had a chance to look at or interact with the proposed bylaws yet, please check out the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/altspace-seattle/c/61EyTI7mYYA/m/9m-I82-zAgAJ">mailing list discussion</a>.</p>
<p>We talked briefly about the wood shop move. The new wood shop is ripe and ready to have more tools moved into it. Any wood workers or other potentially interested parties are encouraged to build or move shelves, workbenches, and tools into the new shop at your discretion. In case you didn't know, the new shop is to the right of the current wood shop/main entrance and the code for it is 4697. You can check out <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/altspace-seattle/c/uI7TFBlz4y8/m/owoC4YgOAgAJ">this thread</a> for some inspiration.</p>
<p>Thanks again and I hope you have a lovely week!</p>

<p>Members in attendance: <strong>Kevin, Vera, Aidan, Matthew, Dan, Noah</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks to Kevin, Vera, Aidan, Matthew, and Dan for attending this month's meeting! Since we have still not yet enacted any bylaws we counted all relevant votes, but for the sake of transparency Dan, Aidan, and myself would all be considered non-voting &quot;legacy&quot; members under the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DYWS71KGy0eut2i6Xbg5lWClZB_6b8Tqlc-VYkAB080/edit?usp=sharing">current draft proposal</a> of the bylaws.</p>
<p>We voted to elect an initial board of directors consisting of:</p>
<p>Mars (6/6 votes)</p>
<p>Kevin (6/6 votes)</p>
<p>Vera (5/6 votes)</p>
<p>Aidan (6/6 votes)</p>
<p>Myself (6/6 votes)</p>
<p>Since Aidan threw himself into the ring at the last minute (and I threw myself back into the ring) you can have a chance to confirm the two of us at our next member's meeting.</p>
<p>As I explained at the meeting we're gonna be kind of in a &quot;dry run&quot; mode for a hot second until we get our bylaws fully ratified. Basically as of now I'll endeavor to carry out the wishes of the board as elected even though they are not yet listed on our official paperwork in order to ease the transition to the new leadership.</p>
<p>We also voted 5/6 (+1 prevote) to <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/altspace-seattle/c/iqypxIRi6Po/m/TUNoE4_qAQAJ">donate $500 to the Local Connectivity Lab</a> in regards to our last half year of being locally connected by them for free. We also voted 5/6 to move the monthly member meetings back to the first Monday of the month so the next meeting will be on May 3rd. This is still amenable to future change if it is discovered there is a day at which a maximal number of members can attend. The monthly meetings drive the major shape and progress of the space so the more engagement we can bring to them the better overall!</p>
<p>Other than that we talked about ways to increase digital engagement (especially during times of lockdown) and Aidan proposed creating a more accessible real-time chat environment by bridging <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> servers. It sounds like Aidan is willing to help set this up but would prefer not to manage the Discord side of things, so if there is anyone with experience using Discord who is interested in administering that please consider volunteering for this role!</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone for making it all possible!</p>

<hr />
<p>Thanks Kevin, Matthew, Scott, and Ben for attending the meeting. Everyone probably wanted to go back outside to enjoy their extra hour, so the meeting was brief.</p>
<p>We voted for Scott to make us a sign of some sort, but decided we should talk to Ron about his plans for signage before we commit to a design. We can share ideas in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/altspace-seattle/c/1HyVYp26wS8/m/XJPD6O6iCAAJ">thread devoted to that idea</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin told us about himself and his aspirations to be on the board. He's a long time member who loves the space and wants to see it succeed. I've long been a fan of Kevin's and I trust him to make wise decisions. He's got my vote!</p>
<p>Unfortunately we didn't hear from any other prospective board members.</p>
<p>We decided to push the question of changing the meeting schedule to the next meeting in the hopes that more interested parties will be able to show up. That means the next meeting will be on... (checks notes)... April 19th--see you there!</p>
<p>We talked about how I'm terrible at leading meetings and sending reminders. I'll try to do better.</p>
<p>Thanks again and enjoy your hour!</p>

<p>Minutes recorded by: <strong>Noah</strong></p>
<p>Members in attendance: <strong>those who attended</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Hey there ALTSpacers,</p>
<p>Thanks to those who attended the meeting last night. We decided we could probably soft-open the space again with a few rules. Here's how it's gonna work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-schedule your usage of the space in one-hour blocks on the <a href="http://www.altspaceseattle.com/calendar">ALTSpace calendar</a>. Put your name and the area you want to use in the title of the event (e.g. &quot;Noah is using the Wood shop&quot;). The areas are Metal shop, Wood shop, Main space.</li>
<li>One person per area at a time. Make sure not to overlap an existing schedule. First come first served! If there is a conflict try to get in touch with the person and work it out.</li>
<li>Pro members can come into the Main space while someone else is working there, practice appropriate social distancing measures. Pro members should still schedule use of the garage-shops.</li>
<li>If you don't yet have the new code contact me and I will tell you. I will keep a list of those who've requested access to the space in case we need to do contact tracing at some point :o</li>
<li>Sanitize tools before putting them away</li>
<li>We're not going to share dust masks. I've temporarily removed the dust masks from the shops. For other safety gear (gloves, safety glasses, etc) consider bringing your own. If you do use ones from the space sanitize them before and after use.</li>
<li>Consider wearing gloves and a mask while you use the space</li>
<li>Wash your hands during and after use of the space</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else you want to add to the list? Discuss it here.</p>
<p>The space has <em>some</em> sanitizing supplies, some clorox wipes, some hand sanitizer, alcohol, bleach, etc. but could use more. If you have extra supplies you don't need please consider bringing them with you and donating them to the space.</p>
<p>There was some concern expressed during the meeting that some people might pull childish stunts like changing other people's scheduled calendar entries or booking up 10 hours every day and coming in at their leisure. I'm hoping we're all above that sort of thing, but at the meeting we agreed this is probably grounds for kicking you out, so play fair and give people the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>I will be working on organizing the supplies closet for the next week or so, so please pardon the chaos towards the front of the main space.</p>
<p>Thanks and stay healthy!</p>

<p>Winter Festival Report</p>

<p>Minutes recorded by: <strong>?</strong></p>
<p>Members in attendance: <strong>?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Jaime, Dillon - other maker spaces in town history, John member for 4 years, Noah member helping manage</p>
<p>Backup plan for people without smartphones for access. Smartcard access sidesteps smartphone. Could have tech problems. Hotel access card registered. Must be manually maintained. Internet access problems. </p>
<ul>
<li>Does it callout?</li>
<li>Keycard is more tried and tested tech. Backup/override</li>
<li>Code on garages as failsafe - change and share with more select group. </li>
</ul>
<p>Have some cameras that need set up</p>
<p>Volunteer commitments for access</p>
<ul>
<li>Had classes and regular events</li>
<li>50/mo fee, full scholarship come in 2x/mo to take out trash</li>
<li>Assess task list - Noah
<ul>
<li>Trash, clean towels, Instructions posted for everything</li>
<li>Be around on a schedule to give tours, sign people up</li>
<li>Sweeping</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Area host approach - Dillon in Chicago with hundreds of members. Each shop had a PIC. People would compete to be the one in charge of that space bc it gave ownership and a person who you had a connection to.</li>
<li>Bounty of a month‚Äôs membership to do specific projects that fell outside of normal</li>
</ul>
<p>Official ‚Äúno-fly‚Äù list - maker community has some known bad entities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Collette has documentation on decisions made.</li>
<li>How does banned from altspace interact with ban from </li>
<li>One person on list was banned from Attic and generally considered to be fine with community but made problem in the space, saying feminism was interfering with his existence. Annoying but not necessarily enough to be banned from events.</li>
<li>Clear that we have ability to assess and plan</li>
<li>Perceptively awkward v. pushing too much, not going to learn</li>
<li>Nice not to have to do in context of the space.</li>
<li>Negative behavior flees to the shadows when positive culture and community are fostered. </li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Need communication about what could be left. Intermix pro and casual members, part of the community encouragement. Public computer area.</p>
<p>Painting event - </p>
<p>Business Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Semi-pro space for a week with any available space for a week.</li>
<li>Bins could be ala cart - same rate</li>
<li>Kick extra in for storage as the chanel for premium, create gradient up to pro by square footage. Representative of load on the space.</li>
<li>Returns on charging extra for the metal shop may not be </li>
<li>Largest, most flexible fluid memberships have the most money. Imagining the use of the metal shop is a big marketing draw.</li>
<li>People might group projects. Open the endless predictable stream of cash.</li>
<li>Storage is the easiest way to rachet up. Flexibility/impulsivity - log into your account and increase your rate quickly. Passive upgrade by claiming a crate. Lowest friction, people have inertia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maker Bar in NJ - regular meetup group. Programming night, soldering night, prefab kits.</p>
<p>Scholarships host a class.</p>
<p>Free month for offering a class where attendees pay. Covers their membership. </p>
<p>Donation based day use breakdown.</p>
<p>,*David needs to make website handoff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Low barrier to entry and not painful if i don‚Äôt exit.</li>
<li>BM wholly owned subsidiary model. Could be entirely independent. Which model are we selecting and why?</li>
<li>Rent pro-space as a group</li>
<li>Volunteers staff from 9am-9pm weekdays, 10am - 10pm weekends, 6hr shift for access</li>
<li>Rejected walk-in day use for lack of a manager ($10 donation)</li>
<li>Balance of pro-space in back for meetings, potlucks, project storage.</li>
<li>300/mo pro, $75 access and bins</li>
<li>Metal shop users should pay a little more. Consumables, insurance, permitting.</li>
<li>Ask the members who used the space</li>
<li>19 pro members would pay the rent, 16 would be optimal
<ul>
<li>Currently 5 pro spaces, </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How much is it worth to Ignition - </li>
<li>Open community access with suggested donation during business hours, 24/7 access for monthly rate</li>
<li>Additional rate for metal shop</li>
<li>Incentive for longer term membership</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiawatha Art Space = $3,200/mo base rent, available end of Sept</li>
<li>Equinox - how do they lease?</li>
<li>existing makers space we pay for access - explored but not feasible.</li>
<li>Hybrid model - continuing current operation but adding Ignition membership.
<ul>
<li>Conversion process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free for everyone. We assume costs and supported by all INW membership ‚Äúdues‚Äù. </li>
<li>Segregated funds building for purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setup</p>
<ul>
<li>Dirtiness gradient v. time of day use</li>
<li>Possibly move sewing area to back. </li>

<h2 id="assets"><a class="header" href="#assets">Assets</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Website lists - http://www.altspaceseattle.com/amenities-tools/</li>
<li>some stuff checked out from owners. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="costs"><a class="header" href="#costs">Costs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently renting for 3k, with extension space would be $4,300. Owner (Ron) keen to rent together.  Water sewer covered</li>
<li>He‚Äôs more amenable to negotiating if it‚Äôs going to be taken over. Will be motivational since he‚Äôd otherwise spend a lot fixing it up. Offer / answer on sooner end. Could probably give tax deductible kickback written into lease.</li>
<li>Fire permit - metal shop, roughly $450/yr, there‚Äôs extra for metal shop consumables.</li>
<li>Internet $80/mo</li>
<li>Electricity varies from $40 - $100/mo billed every 2 months.</li>
<li>Insurance just lapsed, roughly $100 every 3rd month - liability insurance for the LLC.</li>
<li>Currently no renters insurance for theft. Haven‚Äôt had real theft. Had a breakin, guy came through back. Used to be a gate in back, now plywood. Not easy to get in, better for security but harder for access.</li>
<li>$115/year CPI updates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="membership"><a class="header" href="#membership">Membership</a></h2>
<p>http://www.altspaceseattle.com/memberships-rates/</p>
<p>7 pro level members, 20 something $75 members, also got storage. Members have been self selecting because small space shared. Interactions very positive. Maker synergy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro - </li>
<li>Basic - use of public spaces and tools. Not harsh about overnight storage, just can‚Äôt be entitled to the space. </li>
<li>Waivers - assumed risk</li>
<li>Roughly break even right now.</li>
<li>People have been reaching out for tours. We‚Äôre on the Seattle Maker database for folks looking for space. Tours staffed on Sundays. Garage door open and sandwich board out.</li>
<li>Gym membership - lots of people forget to cancel when they quit using. Some intentionally.</li>
<li>Regular members can‚Äôt give code out or leave anyone unsupervised. Pro-members allowed one assistant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules for using the space - http://www.altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/</p>
<h2 id="challenges"><a class="header" href="#challenges">Challenges</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Growing created other problems. Not everyone knows everyone creates lack of accountability. Lack of staff, nobody‚Äôs job to take care of it. </li>
<li>Attrition and vacancy has been the issue. Use the space professionally and personally. </li>
<li>Spring cleaning, stuff accumulates. Had to up membership rates in the back space for storage. Defuckification events. Goodwill/dumptruck/art run. </li>
<li>Personal tools in communal space. Upset when people used them. If you leave it on a common space, it gets used.</li>
<li>Kicking someone out? Management team votes and delegate talks to them - self selected pro members who show up and care, investment in the space. Only about 3-4 total with hundreds here. Once info shared and we have complaints haven‚Äôt had issues with agreement. Clear guidelines. Wasn‚Äôt ultimately a surprise to him. He‚Äôd been informed several times. </li>
<li>Min age 14 with parent, 16 without. Hasn‚Äôt been an issue but one teenager whose parent was a member came in to drink. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other"><a class="header" href="#other">Other</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Relationship with Coyote space. They let us use the courtyard.</li>
<li>Painter used to have workshops for at-risk youth. Too many people in too small a space. Liability consideration in </li>
<li>Small income stream of Seattle Poly meetup. Suggested donations ends up 50-60 per week. Takes over the space and prevents other usage. Probably not worth it. </li>
<li>Lots of freedom to make improvements/additions. E.g. unique keycode access.</li>
<li>Gate entry for meetings is handy to leave open rather than garage space access.</li>
<li>Signage - questions with Ron - smaller signs and placards. Probably wouldn‚Äôt have a problem. Get approval from city of seattle first.</li>
<li>Some of the garage neighbors are cool. Has a community feel. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lessons-learned"><a class="header" href="#lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Well crafted mission statements and values are critical</li>
<li>Explicit organizing documents that codify decision making processes are critical, as is a framework for updating those rules</li>
<li>Come and go memberships don't really work. People aren't invested in the space, don't make it better, and (depending on the person) trash shared infrastructure. If this is a model for the space you're thinking about moving forward, I highly recommend a more onerous tool / space use process. Probably even better are 6-12 month membership plans.</li>
