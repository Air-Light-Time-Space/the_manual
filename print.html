<p>Day-to-day management of the space can be performed on an ad-hoc basis
by anyone who has the time and understands the problem. If you notice
something that needs to be done, perhaps you would be a good person to
do it. If you don't know how to do something ask someone who has done
it before, then add the information to this wiki!</p>
<p>Access to sensitive information (accounts, credentials, keys, etc) is
available on a need-to-know basis. If you need to know, ask around and
someone will tell you.</p>
<p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) of members should only be
shared with directors of the board or agents duly authorized by the
board to handle such data.</p>
<p>If you have time and you love the space consider stepping up to help
keep the place running. By managing the space collectively we ensure

<p>We have two laser engravers: SpiritGX (60x95cm) and Mercury II (43x61cm).
You can etch and even cut out material if it's thin enough.</p>
<h2 id="setup"><a class="header" href="#setup">Setup</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Protect your eyes üëÄ
<ul>
<li>Keep the lid down and don't stare at the laser while it's printing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ventilation
<ul>
<li>The switch is by the metal shop door.</li>
<li>Ensure the ventilation blast gate for your laser cutter is open.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power on the laser engraver.
<ul>
<li>The switch for Mercury II is a little hard to find - it's on the back right corner.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Turn on the air blower. Without it, cuts are much more likely to flame.
<ul>
<li>SpiritGX has a built in air compressor in the cabinet below the engraver.
<ul>
<li>Currently the compressor leaks something fierce, so only have it on while you're engraving.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mercury II is connected to an external air line - open it just a bit to let air flow.
<ul>
<li>Close it when you're done!</li>

<h2 id="software"><a class="header" href="#software">Software</a></h2>
<p>A special print driver is needed to operate the laser engravers.
This is already installed on the workstation connected to the engravers.</p>
<p>I've been using <a href="https://inkscape.org">Inkscape</a> to design my prints and send them to the engravers, but there are probably other options.</p>
<h2 id="raster-vs-vector"><a class="header" href="#raster-vs-vector">Raster vs. Vector</a></h2>
<p>The laser can do two kind of printing.</p>
<h3 id="raster-printing"><a class="header" href="#raster-printing">Raster Printing</a></h3>
<img alt="raster laser engraving goes back and forth" src="/images/laser_engraving_raster.webp" height=200 />
<p>During <strong>raster</strong> printing, the engraver will go back and forth from top to bottom, like an old inkjet printer, and pulse the laser when it's over something that needs to be etched.</p>
<p>This seems to be the &quot;default&quot; way of engraving with our print driver. e.g. if you &quot;File &gt; Print&quot; from Inkscape, it will always print raster.</p>
<h3 id="vector-printing"><a class="header" href="#vector-printing">Vector Printing</a></h3>
<img alt="vector laser engraving follows the shape of the lines" src="/images/laser_engraving_vector.gif" height=200 />
<p>During <strong>vector</strong> printing, the engraver will follow the shape of each line as it engraves.</p>
<p>Vector prints are necessary for cutting out shapes, e.g. if you are making a stencil.
Even if you aren't cutting all the way through material, vector lines tend to be crisper and much faster.</p>
<p>However, vector prints can only be used to etch/cut very thin lines.
You can't use it for broad strokes or for filling in background - raster will be used for that.</p>
<p>Specifically, <strong>the print will only attempt to vector print line widths set between 0.001&quot; (0.025mm), 0.004&quot; (0.1mm)</strong>, everything else will be considered raster.</p>
<img alt="moomin troll creature looking at some text that says 'Keep Clear'" src="/images/laser_engraver_moomin.jpg" height=400 />
<p>It's OK to combine raster and vectors in a single print. In the above &quot;Keep Clear&quot; print, the letter outlines and the border rectangle were vector cut, while the letter fill and the Moomin strokes were done raster, all in a single print job.</p>
<h4 id="steps-for-vector-printing-in-inkscape"><a class="header" href="#steps-for-vector-printing-in-inkscape">Steps for vector printing in Inkscape</a></h4>
<p>Ensure your vector line strokes are set to 0.001&quot; inch.</p>
<p>Go to: <code>Extensions &gt;  Export &gt; Win23 Vector Print</code></p>
<p>This will pop up the print dialog. (üêû It seems to always default to the SpiritGX printer, I haven't figured out how to vector print to Mercury II.)</p>
<p>Select &quot;manual colors&quot; if you'd like to specify laser parameters like power, speed, and PPI. Then adjust settings in the &quot;Pens&quot; tab. 
The default settings seem pretty conservative for things like etching plywood.
A good starting point might be Speed: 30, Power: 100, PPI: 1200, but plan to do some test prints to hone in on your settings.</p>
<h2 id="-inkscape-alpha-crashes"><a class="header" href="#-inkscape-alpha-crashes">üêû Inkscape alpha crashes</a></h2>
<p>There is a bug in the current stable version of Inkscape (v1.2) that prevents vector printing from working.
To work around this we are running an alpha version of Inkscape (v1.3).
Vector printing works, but the software often hangs. Presumably because it's bleeding edge. If you're reading this and a <a href="https://inkscape.org/release/">Inkscape 1.3 or later</a> is out. Give it a try. If it works, update the software on the laser engraver workstation and edit this page!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="electrical"><a class="header" href="#electrical">Electrical</a></h1>
<p>Our space has a fair amount of power, however, sometimes we still trip breakers. Most outlets are labeled with their corresponding circuit for easy identification. As a general principle please do not use multiple power hungry tools on any one circuit. All 120V circuits in the space are 20A.</p>
<p>Be mindful that the second floor has only a single 20A circuit. This was done to provide as much power as possible to the metal and wood shops.</p>
<p>If you do trip a breaker use the diagrams below to identify which circuit you tripped and the corresponding circuit breaker. Please do not enter other tenants spaces without asking permission. If you'd rather someone else deal with the power please send an email to the mailing list, contact the space manager, or post in the discord!</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bi-yearly-air-compressor-servicing"><a class="header" href="#bi-yearly-air-compressor-servicing">Bi-yearly Air Compressor Servicing</a></h1>
<p>Several compressed air lines run through the space. The air compressor lives behind the member storage shelf on the first floor near the laser engravers.</p>
<p>It's good to check the compressor every 6 months or so to make sure it has oil.
There is a reminder to do this on the shared calendar.</p>
<p>Always disconnect the air compressor from power before any kind of servicing - there is a disconnect switch on the wall behind the compressor. The compressor has a large exposed belt and spinning wheel and can start suddenly 
at any time if not disabled. </p>
<p>The large green thing next to the air compressor is an air drying unit, use it if you need the air in the lines to be extra dry, but turn it off when you are done using it. The
tank under the compressor also has a timed discharge port at the back that discharges
any collected condensation on a regular interval (as long as it remains plugged in
and the outlet's protection switch hasn't tripped).</p>

<p>Some of our tools, like welding equipment and the plasma cutter, require us to
have an up to date fire permit - it's a piece of paper hanging in the metal
shop, that must be renewed annually.</p>
<p><img src="images/fire_permit.jpg" alt="fire permit in the metalshop" /></p>
<p>As part of the permitting process, an inspector will stop by unannounced,
usually 1-2 months after the permit is renewed. Among other things, they'll be
verifying that our fire extinguishers have had their annual service. We
typically do them at the same time as the permit, but you can check the tag on
each fire extinguisher in the space to be sure.</p>
<p><img src="images/fire_extinguisher.jpg" alt="fire extinguisher" /></p>
<p>The inspection helps make sure our space is operating safely, and also puts us
on file with the fire department, so that in case there ever <em>is</em> a fire here,
they'll know to respond based on the specific equipment and chemicals we have.</p>

<p>If you bring a guest into the space make sure they fill out a
waiver before they use any tools, or even if they're just going
to be hanging out for awhile.</p>
<p>Completed waivers are kept in the black safe near the side exit and are organized
into a number of folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Pro</em> - All currently active Pro members</li>
<li><em>Basic</em> - All currently active Basic members</li>
<li><em>Supporter</em> - All currently active Supporter members</li>
<li><em>Potential</em> - People who filled out a waiver but haven't signed up yet.
-- It's good to go through these every now and again and shred the ones
that are really old. If our membership is low, you can reach out to these
people before shredding their PII and ask if they're still interested in signing up.</li>
<li><em>Previous users</em> - Not really a folder, but a large stack of previous members/
users of the space, sorted reverse chronologically</li>
<li><em>Possibly not</em> - Waivers of previous users who we may not want to allow to
rejoin the space for whatever reason. Write notes on the back of the waiver.</li>

<p>If you have a waiver you need to file but you don't know the code to the safe,
you can fold it in half and stick it in the cash payments box near the first

<p>Ian has been working with the 3d printer and was unable to connect to it on the documented http://cr10.local.
Turning it off and back on again seemed to get it back online, but he hasn't had a chance to try printing anything yet.</p>
<p>Ian brought his metal chop saw and his grinding wheel into the metal shop. Thanks Ian!</p>
<p>The plasma cutter is online! Noah and Ian made a little test spiral after some chores replacing the control station monitor and keyboard.</p>
<p>Matthew McKenzie has been making steady progress on the railings around the upper mezzanine and work area. Godspeed Matthew.</p>
<p>Matthew McKenzie discussed the upcoming open house event we'll be tabling at Equinox. The hope is to let people know we exist and maybe draw in some new members.
He'll share a post and solicit volunteers on discord soon.</p>
<p>It was noted that new board selection will take place at the next board meeting in January. Greg is thinking about joining the board.
In accordance with the bylaws, the new board members will be confirmed at the general membership at a subsequent regular member meeting.</p>
<p>Greg wants to look into corporate sponsorships for altspace - e.g. for materials.</p>
<p>Greg wants to connect with other maker spaces to learn about how they approach corporate sponsorship. Godspeed Greg.</p>
<p>Rob expressed interest in working on the railing (and maybe small stairs!) for the lower mezzanine. Godspeed Rob.</p>
<p>Metalshop materials storage could use some attention from people who use the metalshop. Ian expressed interest in shepherding this. Godspeed Ian.</p>

<p>Directors not in attendance: <strong>Ava Hahn, Mars Saxman</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Meeting started immediately following the monthly members meeting for November, around 7:00pm.</p>
<p>Andrew called this meeting to pass some bylaws and discuss other compliance requirements for the organization.</p>
<p>Draft bylaws previously written by Noah are discussed and Matthew proposes passing as is to gain compliance then revisiting with more edits and changes at the next annual board meeting.</p>
<p>Noah suggests implementing a couple previously discussed quick fixes, namely striking language mentioning our prior sponsors, Ignition Northwest, and the individual board member spending limit (which was arbitrarily set to $500).</p>
<p>Regarding the spending limit, Greg inquires as to our current average spending, we reviewed the spending worksheet and Matthew informed us he spends &lt; $500/mo and usually batches his expenses.</p>
<p>In a brief diversion Andrew informs us of outstanding balances owed to members: Matthew - $1522.50, Andrew - $380, Michael - $360</p>
<p>Taken to a vote:</p>
<p>Strike references to Ignition Northwest from the bylaws? - <strong>4 votes in favor</strong></p>
<p>Keep $500 spending limit as is? - <strong>3 votes in favor</strong> (Matthew abstains)</p>
<p>Noah moves to pass bylaws with agreed changes - <strong>4 votes in favor</strong></p>
<p>Bylaws must be published for legal compliance, Matthew proposes freezing them to PDF and putting on website. Noah agrees to work on this.</p>
<p>Andrew informs us of our requirement to furnish the state of Washington with yearly social purpose reports and asks for a review of some reports he‚Äôs written. No specific vote was taken, but outlook was favorable. Andrew will file what he‚Äôs got.</p>
<p>Noah asks where people want to keep a running log of board decisions as required in the new bylaws. Andrew proposes google sheets and it is unanimously agreed.</p>
<p>Matthew asks if our vote is enough to make the new bylaws binding, Noah reasons that power to enact initial bylaws ultimately comes from the organizations incorporators which are Noah Tippett and Ben Tramposh, and since Ben has left the board this is probably binding.</p>
<p>Someone asks if we have to send our bylaws to the state and none of us know.</p>
<p>Noah wonders if we have to send meeting minutes to the state. No one knows this either.</p>
<p>Meeting is concluded around 7:13pm</p>

<hr />
<p>Many thanks to Greg, Benjamin, Matt C, Matthew M, Kevin, Andrew and Rob for attending our monthly meeting last night!</p>
<p>Greg told us our request for free ad spend from google was denied by robots, but he appealed and now we're on a 90 day human-review clock.</p>
<p>We talked about some random leaks around the space (it's been raining hard the last few days). Most of them were deemed to be minor, but Andrew agreed to investigate some newer vent work.</p>
<p>Fun projects were discussed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need to build a railing around the unsafe bits of the storage mezzanine, no one volunteered to do this at the meeting, if you're interested then let us know!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need a door to the air compressor space. Noah agreed to investigate sliding hardware to deploy our extra wooden door in this manner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Matthew mentioned that we are Equinox's artist/studio of the month (see: http://equinoxstudios.org/) They will be promoting us all month long on their social media and Matthew has proposed the following dates for open houses:</p>
<p>Thursday November 16, open house from 6-8pm
Thursday November 30, open house from 6-8pm</p>
<p>If you are available at these times consider dropping by the space to hang out and chat with people!</p>
<p>Andrew went over our financials: our revenue from member dues is around $4600/mo, this month we spent $5400, but that includes ~$1700 for insurance which lasts the whole year, so we are currently solvent. Andrew informs us we have about $8500 in the bank. Andrew also informs us we hit 76 members which is an all time high!</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who keeps the space ticking, we'll talk again next month.</p>

<h2 id="will-wants-a-free-metal-lathe"><a class="header" href="#will-wants-a-free-metal-lathe">Will: wants a free metal lathe.</a></h2>
<p>Conext: a couple weeks ago, Tony posted on discord that SnoCo  (in Everett) is trying to get rid of their 42&quot; metal lathe. The conversation in Discord kind of fizzled, so Will re-posed the question: Do we want it?</p>
<p>We discussed some concerns - primarily safety, tool damage, and space.</p>
<p>To address safety and tool damage, we decided the tool should be yellow tagged, to enforce that training happens before it's used.</p>
<p>Regarding space in the metal shop, it's tight, but it seems like we could fit it either in the NE corner by scooching over the welding machines or on the south wall by downsizing the breaker table.</p>
<p>If it's not useful we can resell / regift it.</p>
<p>No one at the meeting was opposed to getting it, and a couple people (Will and Noah) expressed positive interest.</p>
<p>üë∑ TODO: Will needs someone with a truck and some spare hands to help move from Snohomish. (post-meeting UPDATE: Will may have a line on a truck...)</p>
<h2 id="matthew-msm-reminded-the-group-we-have-computers-to-sell"><a class="header" href="#matthew-msm-reminded-the-group-we-have-computers-to-sell">Matthew (MSM): reminded the group we have computers to sell.</a></h2>
<p>We still have pretty much all the computers we obtained from the shutting-down architecture firm a few months ago.
A few are being used in the space, and Matthew Chang is going to set one up in his pro-space.
We previously agreed that we could sell the extras for fundraising, but no one has yet.
Attendees expressed being open to selling them in bulk if it makes it easier.</p>
<h2 id="matt-chang-talked-about-paid-storage-options"><a class="header" href="#matt-chang-talked-about-paid-storage-options">Matt (Chang): talked about paid storage options.</a></h2>
<p>In general, storage is not free, because it takes up space that other people could be using.
e.g. Alex paid for his under-the-stairs storage (thank you Alex!) and Will pays for his tub storage (thank you Will!).</p>
<p>A day or two is OK, but longer term personal storage needs to be negotiated with the organization. We've got a couple of options including a pro-space, a half-pro-space, individual tub storage.
Talk to the space manager (Matt Chang) or ask on discord/mailing list to work something out.</p>

<p>Every so often our door access system poops the bed and just leaves the door unlocked. It seems to be a bug in our door lock software/firmware.</p>
<p>Noah has a theory that, in the meanwhile, we can avoid the issue by resetting the system every so often, which he did tonight at the meeting.</p>

<p>Altspace is different from a lot of other places, so it's important to give new members the right idea. We brainstormed some essential things to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>tag system (red/yellow/blue or untagged)</li>
<li>exterior door: there's a little jiggle dance you have to do to get it open. Have them try.</li>
<li>lock up when you leave</li>
<li>Ask the new member what project(s) they are pursuing so you can give them any specific tool orientations relevant to them.</li>
<li>There is no one responsible for cleaning up your messes except yourself, so clean up after yourself + an extra 20%.</li>

<h2 id="andrew-reviewed-our-finances"><a class="header" href="#andrew-reviewed-our-finances">Andrew: reviewed our finances</a></h2>
<p>We are just barely in the black. We spend most of our money on rent, but also have cash expenses. Currently 67 members.</p>
<p>We spent about $12k on the move to our current space. Our landlord has been open with us from the beginning that our current space will be redeveloped and we'll eventually have to move out. The timeline is uncertain, but approximately 2+ years from now. The landlord will work to rehouse us in one of his other buildings, but we should build up another nestegg because moving is expensive.</p>
<p>Other money-making ideas were mentioned, like grants, sponsorships, and group memberships, but nothing specific was proposed yet.</p>

<p>It's happened twice now that our access control system has gotten into a bad state where it stays unlocked - meaning both our interior and exterior doors are accessible. üò¨</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, wait a second after closing the door and make sure it's locked behind you. If it's not locking, power cycle the access control system, or at least post on discord so someone else can deal with it.</p>

<h2 id="noah-filed-our-federal-taxes-"><a class="header" href="#noah-filed-our-federal-taxes-">Noah: filed our federal taxes. üí∏</a></h2>
<p>Noah successfully filed last three years of federal taxes.</p>
<p>We may be liable for a fine for the filing delays, but Noah requested an exemption.
Noah mentioned <em>worst case</em> would be something like $10/day up to $10k, but given we're such a small organization that seems unlikely.</p>
<p>(https://www.irs.gov/payments/failure-to-file-penalty says the max penalty is 25% of your taxes, so it seems like it'd be much less than that if they decide to fine at all)</p>
<ul>
<li>üë∑ TODO Noah: Official change of address form</li>
<li>üë∑ TODO Noah:  Washington state taxes</li>
<li>üë∑ TODO Michael: Business license renewal (update board members).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="michael-noted-meeting-attendance-is-sparse"><a class="header" href="#michael-noted-meeting-attendance-is-sparse">Michael: noted meeting attendance is sparse.</a></h2>
<p>It'd be nice to have more people at the meetings. We talked about some ways to have automated reminders and to solicit agenda items.</p>
<ul>
<li>üë∑ TODO michael: set up calendaring system to remind himself to broadcast via email/discord ~5 days before the meeting and the day before the meeting.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="noah-reported-the-video-conference-link-is-broken"><a class="header" href="#noah-reported-the-video-conference-link-is-broken">Noah: reported the video conference link is broken.</a></h2>
<p>We used to have a stable link to our video conference / virtual meeting at aloha.altspaceseattle.com. It's currently broken so we've been using an adhoc solution in the meanwhile. Michael may have broken it while updating our website ssl (sorry!).</p>
<p>It's partially a custom piece of software written by Noah.</p>
<ul>
<li>üë∑ TODO michael: going to &quot;take a look&quot; and probably ask Noah for help if he gets stuck.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="maxx-wants-to-tweak-the-layout-upstairs"><a class="header" href="#maxx-wants-to-tweak-the-layout-upstairs">Maxx: wants to tweak the layout upstairs.</a></h2>
<p>Maxx proposed swapping the electronics+3-d printers with the sewing area, so that the soldering and 3-d printers can be closer to potential ventilation access along the North wall.</p>
<ul>
<li>üë∑ TODO maxx: follow up w/ Matt Mackenzie (@msm) who's been actively organizing the upstairs space.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="maxx-is-going-to-donate-a-workbench"><a class="header" href="#maxx-is-going-to-donate-a-workbench">Maxx: is going to donate a workbench.</a></h2>
<p>Maxx has a 48&quot;x32&quot;ish workbench on wheels and offered to donate it. We thought it was a good idea. Noah is going to provide a truck and they're going to move it into the space this weekend.</p>
<ul>

<h2 id="michael-wants-to-sell-excess-computers-for-fundraising"><a class="header" href="#michael-wants-to-sell-excess-computers-for-fundraising">Michael: wants to sell excess computers for fundraising.</a></h2>
<p>We were recently donated a bunch of tools and desktop PC's (like 18?).
Some are being, or will be, put to good use around the space, but we're unlikely to utilize all of them.</p>
<p>Michael thinks we should sell the remainder.
No concerns raised by the group, but it was noted we could probably get more money selling them individually vs. taking the entire lot to e.g. RE-PC.
Though it might make sense to offer a bulk discount.</p>
<ul>
<li>üë∑ TODO Michael: Post some computers on craiglist/offerup/w.e.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="michael-realized-we-have-a-functioning-phone"><a class="header" href="#michael-realized-we-have-a-functioning-phone">Michael: realized we have a functioning phone.</a></h2>
<p>Just dial 1-87-SPACE-ALTS!</p>
<p>Michael was surprised when the phone in the space rang and answered it and it was a real person calling for a tour. Apparently Dan fixed the phone recently. Thanks Dan!</p>
<p>Long ago (at the cherry st. location?) there used to be a failover, so if no one answered the phone, it'd roll over to a members cell phone, but that no longer seems to be in place.
We could set that up again, but no one stepped up to bottom line this.</p>
<ul>
<li>üë∑ TODO &quot;someone should&quot;: set up phone failover system. Maybe a pager-duty style rotation to spread the burden.</li>
</ul>

<p>Matt wants to set up a pottery station with our potters wheel.
It might be especially good for people who can't operate within Seattle Artist League's hours.
No concerns raised by the group.</p>
<h2 id="maxx-is-concerned-about-dust-upstairs"><a class="header" href="#maxx-is-concerned-about-dust-upstairs">Maxx: is concerned about dust upstairs.</a></h2>
<p>Maxx suggested hanging some sheets or other dividers.
No specific plan of action was proposed, but it seemed like a good concept with no objections raised.</p>

<p>Members in attendance: <strong>Kevin, Ankur, Matthew, Andrew, Craig, Era, Ken, Noah</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Many thanks to Kevin, Ankur, Matthew, Andrew, Craig, Era, and Ken for attending the meeting last night! The hybrid meeting with the new equipment worked pretty well.</p>
<p>When using the new door please make sure to close it securely behind you. The door closer cannot be relied on to fully shut the door. (If anyone wants to mess with it feel free, the pin that can be used to set the level of tension seems to be bent and stuck in its current position). <strong>In the meantime, please make sure the front door is fully closed whenever you use it.</strong></p>
<p>Era offered to head up a team to tackle the ventilation needs of the shop so if anyone else is interested in working on that reach out and we'll get you in touch.</p>
<p>We voted to spend ~$60 on a retractable air hose from harbor freight, I'll try to stop by and grab one sometime this week.</p>
<p>We're interested in formalizing a manager position to make sure the space keeps running in a clean and efficient manner. This volunteer position would include a free desk space, booper for the back gate, and possibly other perks. The responsibilities would be basically those laid out in: altspace.wiki/responsibilities.html#space-manager</p>
<p>If anyone is interested in filling this position please speak up!</p>
<p>Let's plan to have an official vote on this issue and make the role available at our next meeting on January 2nd.</p>
<p>Many thanks to Ken and Ankur for moving all the stuff out of the public hallway! That is no longer something we need to worry about.</p>
<p>It sounds like many people will be out of town for some or all of the holiday season so we weren't able to get any good coordination at the meeting about ongoing build-out and organizing efforts this month, but if you're around definitely feel free to plug away at something and coordinate on here or in the discord.</p>
<p>Thanks everybody and happy December!</p>

<hr />
<p>Thanks to Rick, Zira, and Andrew for attending the meeting last night!</p>
<p>It was a sparsely attended and unfocused meeting, so we didn't make any important decisions.</p>
<p>Andrew has built a rather fine bridge from the large mezzanine to the area above the shops. Also Andrew, Benjamin, Zira, Michael and others have finished putting the ceiling up in the wood shop.</p>
<p>We still need to put a ceiling up in the metal shop, get some lights mounted in the wood shop, build some railings around the upper level and get that area set up, figure out the heater, etc... So we figured we'd try to have another work party this Sunday to do some of that stuff.</p>
<p>Come by the space this Sunday, and maybe the next few Sundays too and help us polish up the space!</p>
<p>Also in January we will need new officers so if you are interested in being Treasurer, Secretary, or President of ALTSpace, join the board asap! How do you join the board? Just write to this mailing list and we'll vote you in at the next meeting on December 5th.</p>
<p>Many thanks to everyone who keeps altspace afloat!</p>

<hr />
<p>Big thanks to Andrew, Ankur, Benjamin, Kevin, Scott, Vera &amp; Esther for attending the meeting last night!</p>
<p>The property search continues. It sounds like we missed the boat on the place we were looking at in SODO, but we are 2nd on the waiting list if their current prospect falls through.</p>
<p>Andrew set up a google sheet to track the options that have come up: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lHkda-J2jZ8jx5hdVO1AKToYczkEJN-Nzj4hSiAxrxc/edit#gid=0</p>
<p>Kevin and Benjamin will reach out to Equinox Studios in Georgetown to see if there's a possibility of us finding room there.</p>
<p>Timeline wise we decided if we don't have a new space set up by the beginning of May we'll start winding the space down. We have till June 1st to move out, but we can move out sooner if we get our act together.</p>
<p>If you know of any good commercial real estate or have a commercial real estate broker you've worked with before you should use Andrew's spreadsheet and coordinate in the #locations discord channel. If you want to apply to a place and there's a reasonable application fee the space will reimburse that.</p>
<p>In other news, the Local Connectivity Lab is looking for technically aware volunteers who can help them as they expand their 4g and wifi community network. They need volunteers who can troubleshoot technical problems and help them onboard new clients. If you're interested, get in touch with Esther at the LCL!</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

<h2 id="heat"><a class="header" href="#heat">Heat</a></h2>
<p>Val brought up the concern about the lack of heat.</p>
<p>Andrew: traced power from the heaters to the thermostat by the side door.
Looked like someone had previously pulled the thermostat out, but he didn't
want to mess with it further.</p>
<p>Val: Should the landlord take care of that? Is it in the lease? (lease is by
the side door)</p>
<p>(Any input from folks who are in the know is welcome)</p>
<h2 id="woodshop"><a class="header" href="#woodshop">Woodshop</a></h2>
<p>The woodshop is a very (the most?) busy desirable space right now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Longer term we can look into getting the north space back (if the numbers pan
out, it would require a capitol investment), or consider alternative spaces,
but in the immediate term we have ratified the following proposal:</li>
</ul>
<p>Ankur: (via noah) there <em>was</em> some incentive in renting north and south space
together from landlord since north space can be accessed from south space.</p>
<p>Ankur: Having front facing space is good advertising.</p>
<p>Aidan: garage front is nice. We have some duplicate tools, maybe even having
two woodshop spaces is doable.  Let's take account after new insurance is due,
since there might be ramifications.</p>
<p>Ankur: biggest bottleneck is access to tablesaw. When scheduleing - indicate if
you‚Äôre open to sharing the space or if you want the entire shop. do you need:
table saw, cross cut saw, assembly</p>
<p>Bryan: proposed maybe there be some kind of per-member hours budget</p>
<p>Ankur: maybe that will discourage new members...</p>
<h3 id="calendaring-proposal"><a class="header" href="#calendaring-proposal">Calendaring Proposal</a></h3>
<p>When reserving time on the shared calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Members are asked to include contact information on their bookings
on the calendar so that multiple people using the space can be negotiated.</li>
<li>Members should limit schedule bookings to 4 hours maximum and will lose
priority if more than 15 minutes late to their booking.</li>
<li>Unanimously approved across 7 members</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="vending-machine-update-from-michael"><a class="header" href="#vending-machine-update-from-michael">Vending machine update from Michael:</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>still looking through leads, many folks have flaked. Noah has a lead (Matt)
who is interested in it. We are working on having it extracted.</li>
<li>in 1 week we will authorize spending to borrow a truck for up to 50$ to get
the vending machine for matt if noah has not been able to assist us.</li>

<li>The treasurer reserves the right to veto a reimbursement in cases of abuse.</li>
<li>Unanimously approved across 6 members (Andrew had to leave before we voted)</li>

<p>Altspace Meeting Minutes 11/1/2021 
8 members attended and noted the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Val will be in charge of the scholarship program</li>
<li>Heat in altspace is not yet a thing as the base heaters are broken. People bringing in space heaters is welcome but risky if someone leaves theirs on.</li>
<li>Michael will set up a temperature probe</li>
<li>Membership meetings should stay primarily virtual even beyond the pandemic because that is easiest for the membership who are scattered across the state and more. A proposal may be made to create a better tech solution to have a hybrid virtual and in person approach in the space. </li>
<li>A whitelist of common supplies should be solicited from the membership of which any member can purchase an amount of for the space and be reimbursed by the treasurer without needing a vote at a membership meeting</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the 8 present members voted on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unanimous vote to discard the vending machine. Michael will put it on craigslist</li>
<li>Unanimous vote to approve a 500 dollar investment in putting an antenna on top of altspace for Open Connectivity Lab</li>
<li>Unanimous vote to approve up to 500 dollars in networking equipment for Edward to use in setting up a network at altspace</li>
</ul>
<p>Topics including Calendly integrations and woodshop conflicts were punted to the next meeting as affected members were not present.</p>
<p>Special thanks to Michael Kirk and Edward for committing to follow up on several points voted on by membership present at the meeting.</p>

<hr />
<p>Hello All,
Just a reminder:
Our monthly member meetings are held every first Monday of the month at 6:30 on Jitsi. The link to join is always posted here and in the discord.... save for this Monday evidently. In the future, the email notifications will be automated and the link will be static. The meetings are a time where any member at basic level or higher can propose purchases of new tools or parts, changes to rules, or raise any concerns they may have about the space. The vast majority of decisions affecting the maker space are made at these meetings democratically by the attending members.</p>
<p>Here is a summary of today's meeting:
3 attending member came to a full consensus on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>follow up with Val and see how the sewing machines need servicing. Altspace budget should be used for any parts or services needed</li>
<li>thread should be acquired for all sewing machines</li>
<li>a new iron should be acquired for the sewing area</li>
<li>our current iron should be discarded</li>
<li>Marshall is authorized to place flytraps around the space</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the following comments were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>folks need to be cleaning up after themselves. Some amount of custodial work is not yet happening. This may also fit into our current scholarship options for folks seeking less expensive basic memberships</li>
<li>we should investigate the band saw. It is not able to cut through wood or aluminum anymore. Unsure if repairs or replacement are needed. If any member can take a look and post their findings here or in the discord that would be wonderful!</li>
<li>we should look into having stewards for each area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Noah mentioned that there are 5 members of the board and we need 4 officers, so he‚Äôs hoping each person can step up to be an officer. There are: President, Vice president, Treasurer, Secretary. </p>

<ul>
<li>Filing paperwork with the state and federal government for taxes etc</li>
<li>Onboard new members, give tours (others can and have been helping w ith this)</li>
<li>Makes sure all of our stuff like fire extinguishers are in compliance (needs tobe done but not necessarily by an officer)</li>
<li>Takes out trash and cleans up space</li>
<li>Keeps track of all paperwork like secretary, though not as officially as one might ‚Äì could be nice to have filing cabinet in the space</li>
<li>Has credit card for space and can buy stuff</li>
<li>Keeps track of bank accounts ‚Äì more people can be added with different limits, so can make this more complicated as needed.</li>
<li>Making decisions to keep Altspace functioning ‚Äì trying to do this with as much feedback and input as he can. </li>
<li>Proposing bylaws and changes to Altspace</li>
</ul>
<p>Aiden asked whether there is something that fits in with what he‚Äôs been doing for the space ‚Äì hosting meetings and giving tours is something he‚Äôs been doing. What would fit with officer position? 
Noah said this could be President/Vice president for officer, though anyone could be giving tours. Some member of the board should be at each members meeting so this could also fit with your interests. Aiden then said he understands Board; do all officers need to be elected today? An alternative might be to elect people who are willing today, but also could recruit officers at members meeting. </p>
<p>Noah said we need bylaws officially voted on by the end of Sept. filing deadline. We might need officers by the time we file those bylaws. You commitment would be only til January if you‚Äôre anything but the Vice President, who becomes President the next year. Noah imagines recruiting for the board in fall, then each officer chooses their successor in January. </p>
<p>Vera asked if someone needs to leave the board for any reason, what do they do? Noah mentioned this is in the bylaws: Can write letter to the board, Can stop paying dues and leave (automatic departure). Then the board will do a special meeting to select a new officer in that spot. Also the members can remove a board member/officer, and this removal motion needs to propose a replacement. </p>
<p>Vera wants to know the &quot;job description&quot; for each officer role. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>President</strong> ‚Äì Makes sure everyone else is doing their job. Writes letters to the membership on how we‚Äôre doing.</li>
<li><strong>Vice President</strong> ‚Äì Learning how to be the President, steps in while P is on vacation. </li>
<li><strong>Secretary</strong> ‚Äì Take notes at meetings, create cohesive notation of all decisions we‚Äôve made at meetings or not at meetings (decided between board members), file paperwork with secretary of state to list directors, any other annual filings, keeping track of all of Altspace paperwork ‚Äì insurance, bank account, loan, list of members. Some of this could be electronic but that‚Äôs not designed yet. Default is paper.</li>
<li><strong>Treasurer</strong> ‚Äì In charge of accounts, files taxes (or makes sure they‚Äôre filed by accountant). Has access to bank account, gives access to others who need it, make sure use of money is in compliance with AltSpace needs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Aiden asked if list of current members would be gleaned from PayPal. Noah said actually he made a current list that‚Äôs in a Google Doc. Most people pay on PayPal, but some people pay cash or check, so those wouldn‚Äôt show up on PayPal. Noah has done the filing for this year.
<strong>Aiden volunteers to be secretary!</strong></p>
<p>Mars made a life decision and thinks he might need to exit the board. He bought a sailboat in North Carolina to fix up and live on! He still loves and wants to support AltSpace, but can‚Äôt really help after the end of October. He doesn‚Äôt know how we feel about that. Noah is happy for Mars to stay on the board even under those circumstances. Mars is happy to be connected to AltSpace, to help with disasters, but not able to be consistently available for meetings. Noah confirms that a non-officer board position would be a good fit for Mars. He mentions that that kind of position would be possible for Vera too. </p>
<p>Vera says treasurer too much for her but she could take on Vice President for now, though she‚Äôs not sure about automatically becoming President next year. </p>
<p>Noah says he can be president and Treasurer. And he could change bylaws to remove being Vice President. And discussed some other details.</p>
<p>So, officially: </p>
<ul>
<li>Noah will be Vice President and Treasurer</li>
<li>Vera will be President</li>
<li>Aiden is Secretary</li>
</ul>
<p>Vera is still interested in more detailed job descriptions, especially hers. 
Right now Noah is the shop manager, so if she sees things that are a problem she lets Noah know. 
The only real responsibility of the president is to roll a dice at meetings when there‚Äôs a tie. Otherwise it‚Äôs being the voice to the membership. 
Noah says her only job for now can be trying to make people sign up for the board.</p>
<p>Noah will contact Kevin, who missed the meeting today, to let him know about this. </p>
<p>Votes for officers: </p>
<ul>
<li>4/4 votes for Aiden as secretary</li>
<li>4/4 votes for Noah vice president </li>
<li>4/4 votes for Noah treasurer</li>
<li>4/4 votes for Vera president</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rates"><a class="header" href="#rates">Rates</a></h2>
<p>Noah proposes we make $250 the new rate for Pro membership ‚Äì 4/4 yes</p>
<p>Basic rate moved to $65 for voting? ‚Äì 4/4 yes</p>
<p>Vera says she thinks it could be a little more expensive than $50. Noah says he chose the $50 rate for Basic members because they were 2/3 of the membership and we didn‚Äôt have pros at beginning of COVID. Now we‚Äôre saying your $50/person</p>
<p>Keep supporter name your own price? 3 of 4 board members say Yes</p>
<h2 id="bylaws"><a class="header" href="#bylaws">Bylaws</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Bylaws proposed to membership? ‚Äì 4/4 yes
The bylaws are in email but once ratified these will be posted on our website. 
First 3 years, board members can make changes by 2/3 vote. After 3 years the membership needs to vote on changes to the bylaws.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="insurance"><a class="header" href="#insurance">Insurance</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Accept staying Insured ‚Äì 4/4 votes, yes</li>
<li>Extra liability personal board insurance ‚Äì 0/4 votes (though Vera seemed a little on the fence; can vote again in January)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="protocolsorganization"><a class="header" href="#protocolsorganization">Protocols/Organization</a></h2>
<p>****** is code of the safe at Altspace (bythe back door)
Membership list is in the safe. Pro member waivers are there. (Not as up-to-date as he‚Äôd like; Aiden might update)
Volunteers/Scholars are in there too, and Basic members.
Also in the safe: Gigantic stack of ‚Äúnot members but have waivers‚Äù. All previous member waivers are good for if they sue us or other purposes.
Also a list of members who we might want to not have as members ever again. No reasons mentioned there but there are notes in the Google Sheet. (Called ‚ÄúPossibly not‚Äù)
Potential member waivers ‚Äì filled out a waiver but never joined. He historically has kept them around for 3-4 months and went through to contact recent folks to see if they want to sign up. But then shred them after a while to protect their confidential information.</p>
<p>Other system is Pay Rent in Cash box. Noah was going to give keys to other board members. This box also holds keys to garages. </p>
<h2 id="oberon"><a class="header" href="#oberon">Oberon</a></h2>
<p>Has been in the space since he was kicked out. Don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs been in the space since we changed the locks. Aiden says he‚Äôs not a problem right now; wait til he makes contact again. Aiden was worried about it because he wanted things from us. Noah said he needs to provide detailed list of what is his, and proof that it was his. He hasn‚Äôt provided that.</p>
<h2 id="other-notes"><a class="header" href="#other-notes">Other notes</a></h2>
<p>Vera wants to figure out where to electronically track our documents etc. </p>
<ul>
<li>INW had Google Drive and our stuff is on there.</li>
<li>Aiden doesn‚Äôt like Google and Noah happy to go away from it. </li>
<li>Vera is happy with Wave Accounting, and it‚Äôs free. </li>
</ul>
<p>Other agenda items?
<strong>Wet walls for winter?</strong> Vera asked if this will be a problem this year. Noah says he hopes that the renovations are good for this. Alternately, this is a courtyard overflow issue that Ron needs a french drain for. So we‚Äôd wait til after signing a new lease to ask for a solution to this. </p>
<p>Long-term, if Ron doesn‚Äôt kick us out but he seems iffy on Altspace, maybe we could buy the second <strong>Coyote Central lot</strong> from them. If Altspace dissolves for some reason, the assets currently go to INW. But if we bought their lot we could give assets to Coyote Central. </p>
<p>Long-term if we get kicked out, we could move elsewhere. We make money now. Noah recently made an address sign for Ron so maybe that gives us better relationship.</p>
<p>Mars says he‚Äôs impressed with the revenue. He hasn‚Äôt seen Altspace thrive quite so well. Noah says he doesn‚Äôt feel like he‚Äôs done anything special but hopefully putting together the bylaws will help keep whatever we‚Äôre doing well, going.</p>
<p>Vera asked <strong>what‚Äôs going on with the north space.</strong> Noah said that we‚Äôre pulling 4,600 now. But we‚Äôd need 7,000 or 8,000 revenue to afford the back space too. And Ron would like to rent these spaces together. Noah would like to rent it with a buffer. We‚Äôre in ‚Äúwait and see‚Äù mode now though.</p>

<p>Many thanks to Ankur, Aidan, Yossi, Marshall, Dan, and Kevin for making it to the meeting last night!</p>
<p>We voted 6/7 to buy the stuff in the linked proposal plus new air filters for the wen air handler in the main garage, a new fence for the miter saw in the wood shop, a raspberry pi for the delta 3d printer and a new mainboard for the  printrbot metal. With the battery deal Jason identified I think the total should still be around $1000. I will endeavor to start acquiring these things for us. If anyone has any ideas for which free power tools we should acquire with our batteries let me know, otherwise I will probably just get a couple more power drills.</p>
<p>We also discussed COVID restrictions and were all of the opinion that allowing guests back into the space at this point is probably not problematic. If you have any concerns about it please speak up, otherwise I think we should tentatively re-allow guests at this point and vote on a more in-depth re-opening plan at our next meeting on August 2nd.</p>
<p>Thanks everyone for all your hard work!</p>

<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>At today's monthly member's meeting a panel consisting of Michael, Marshall, Dan, and I all approved the relaxed COVID-19 guidelines as proposed by Noah on this mailing list. Ill include them below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>More than one person per shop now allowed</strong></li>
<li><strong>Continue using the calendar for scheduling so that we can contact trace if a spreading event happens</strong></li>
<li><strong>Wear masks if more than one person is in the space</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you prefer operating under stricter or more relaxed guidelines please attend the next monthly members meeting. If you have any concerns or accessibility needs that are precluded by these guidelines please let us all know so that we can accommodate you. </p>
<p>Thanks,
Aidan</p>

<p>Members in attendance: <strong>Matthew, Aidan, Ben, Kevin, Salt, Noah</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks so much to Matthew, Aidan, Ben, Kevin, and Salt for joining this month's meeting, we had some very productive conversation and a lovely time.</p>
<p>We voted 6/6 to start using Jitsi for all future meetings, and even managed to transition the meeting to Jitsi partway through. There may be some slight logistical challenges setting up a permanent unchanging meeting URI, but several potential solutions were discussed. Stay tuned for further updates, our next meeting will be on Monday, June 7th.</p>
<p>We also confirmed the last-minute board nominations of both Aidan (6/6) and myself (5/6).</p>
<p>Other than that, we talked a bit about signage (we are waiting for construction before we start installing any new permanent signs, but Aidan is going to try pressure washing our name into the sidewalk).</p>
<p>We had some very fruitful discussion about bylaws and the mechanics of implementing a functional maker space. We're hoping to have a member-wide vote for the enacting of some bylaws possibly as early as our next meeting, so if you haven't had a chance to look at or interact with the proposed bylaws yet, please check out the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/altspace-seattle/c/61EyTI7mYYA/m/9m-I82-zAgAJ">mailing list discussion</a>.</p>
<p>We talked briefly about the wood shop move. The new wood shop is ripe and ready to have more tools moved into it. Any wood workers or other potentially interested parties are encouraged to build or move shelves, workbenches, and tools into the new shop at your discretion. In case you didn't know, the new shop is to the right of the current wood shop/main entrance and the code for it is 4697. You can check out <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/altspace-seattle/c/uI7TFBlz4y8/m/owoC4YgOAgAJ">this thread</a> for some inspiration.</p>
<p>Thanks again and I hope you have a lovely week!</p>

<p>Members in attendance: <strong>Kevin, Vera, Aidan, Matthew, Dan, Noah</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Thanks to Kevin, Vera, Aidan, Matthew, and Dan for attending this month's meeting! Since we have still not yet enacted any bylaws we counted all relevant votes, but for the sake of transparency Dan, Aidan, and myself would all be considered non-voting &quot;legacy&quot; members under the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DYWS71KGy0eut2i6Xbg5lWClZB_6b8Tqlc-VYkAB080/edit?usp=sharing">current draft proposal</a> of the bylaws.</p>
<p>We voted to elect an initial board of directors consisting of:</p>
<p>Mars (6/6 votes)</p>
<p>Kevin (6/6 votes)</p>
<p>Vera (5/6 votes)</p>
<p>Aidan (6/6 votes)</p>
<p>Myself (6/6 votes)</p>
<p>Since Aidan threw himself into the ring at the last minute (and I threw myself back into the ring) you can have a chance to confirm the two of us at our next member's meeting.</p>
<p>As I explained at the meeting we're gonna be kind of in a &quot;dry run&quot; mode for a hot second until we get our bylaws fully ratified. Basically as of now I'll endeavor to carry out the wishes of the board as elected even though they are not yet listed on our official paperwork in order to ease the transition to the new leadership.</p>
<p>We also voted 5/6 (+1 prevote) to <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/altspace-seattle/c/iqypxIRi6Po/m/TUNoE4_qAQAJ">donate $500 to the Local Connectivity Lab</a> in regards to our last half year of being locally connected by them for free. We also voted 5/6 to move the monthly member meetings back to the first Monday of the month so the next meeting will be on May 3rd. This is still amenable to future change if it is discovered there is a day at which a maximal number of members can attend. The monthly meetings drive the major shape and progress of the space so the more engagement we can bring to them the better overall!</p>
<p>Other than that we talked about ways to increase digital engagement (especially during times of lockdown) and Aidan proposed creating a more accessible real-time chat environment by bridging <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> and <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> servers. It sounds like Aidan is willing to help set this up but would prefer not to manage the Discord side of things, so if there is anyone with experience using Discord who is interested in administering that please consider volunteering for this role!</p>
<p>Thanks again everyone for making it all possible!</p>

<hr />
<p>Thanks Kevin, Matthew, Scott, and Ben for attending the meeting. Everyone probably wanted to go back outside to enjoy their extra hour, so the meeting was brief.</p>
<p>We voted for Scott to make us a sign of some sort, but decided we should talk to Ron about his plans for signage before we commit to a design. We can share ideas in the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/altspace-seattle/c/1HyVYp26wS8/m/XJPD6O6iCAAJ">thread devoted to that idea</a>.</p>
<p>Kevin told us about himself and his aspirations to be on the board. He's a long time member who loves the space and wants to see it succeed. I've long been a fan of Kevin's and I trust him to make wise decisions. He's got my vote!</p>
<p>Unfortunately we didn't hear from any other prospective board members.</p>
<p>We decided to push the question of changing the meeting schedule to the next meeting in the hopes that more interested parties will be able to show up. That means the next meeting will be on... (checks notes)... April 19th--see you there!</p>
<p>We talked about how I'm terrible at leading meetings and sending reminders. I'll try to do better.</p>
<p>Thanks again and enjoy your hour!</p>

<hr />
<p>Hey there ALTSpacers,</p>
<p>Thanks to those who attended the meeting last night. We decided we could probably soft-open the space again with a few rules. Here's how it's gonna work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-schedule your usage of the space in one-hour blocks on the <a href="http://www.altspaceseattle.com/calendar">ALTSpace calendar</a>. Put your name and the area you want to use in the title of the event (e.g. &quot;Noah is using the Wood shop&quot;). The areas are Metal shop, Wood shop, Main space.</li>
<li>One person per area at a time. Make sure not to overlap an existing schedule. First come first served! If there is a conflict try to get in touch with the person and work it out.</li>
<li>Pro members can come into the Main space while someone else is working there, practice appropriate social distancing measures. Pro members should still schedule use of the garage-shops.</li>
<li>If you don't yet have the new code contact me and I will tell you. I will keep a list of those who've requested access to the space in case we need to do contact tracing at some point :o</li>
<li>Sanitize tools before putting them away</li>
<li>We're not going to share dust masks. I've temporarily removed the dust masks from the shops. For other safety gear (gloves, safety glasses, etc) consider bringing your own. If you do use ones from the space sanitize them before and after use.</li>
<li>Consider wearing gloves and a mask while you use the space</li>
<li>Wash your hands during and after use of the space</li>
</ul>
<p>Anything else you want to add to the list? Discuss it here.</p>
<p>The space has <em>some</em> sanitizing supplies, some clorox wipes, some hand sanitizer, alcohol, bleach, etc. but could use more. If you have extra supplies you don't need please consider bringing them with you and donating them to the space.</p>
<p>There was some concern expressed during the meeting that some people might pull childish stunts like changing other people's scheduled calendar entries or booking up 10 hours every day and coming in at their leisure. I'm hoping we're all above that sort of thing, but at the meeting we agreed this is probably grounds for kicking you out, so play fair and give people the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>I will be working on organizing the supplies closet for the next week or so, so please pardon the chaos towards the front of the main space.</p>
<p>Thanks and stay healthy!</p>

<li>Previous:  ALTSpace will be a community institution with limitless possibilities to design, build, and perform creative endeavors in the company of inspiring people. A collaborative hub that can accommodate large scale art builds, learning and education spaces, community meetings, interactive galleries, performances, and events such as potlucks and group fundraisers. </li>
<li>Brainstorming:
<ul>
<li>Make epic shit - supporting the making of</li>
<li>Share, learn, creative collaboration</li>

<ul>

<li>501c7 is a possibility</li>

<li>Suggestion: Everyone who shows up a given monday is the Committee for the month</li>
<li>Smaller meetings month to month or as needed with a couple annual member meetings</li>
<li>Need a paid manager - Noah is working on automating a lot.</li>
<li>&quot;Tenure&quot; or other designation for members involved for longer than x period</li>
<li>Opportunity to learn about business management in addition to other crafts</li>

<hr />
<p>Jaime, Dillon - other maker spaces in town history, John member for 4 years, Noah member helping manage</p>
<p>Backup plan for people without smartphones for access. Smartcard access sidesteps smartphone. Could have tech problems. Hotel access card registered. Must be manually maintained. Internet access problems. </p>
<ul>
<li>Does it callout?</li>
<li>Keycard is more tried and tested tech. Backup/override</li>
<li>Code on garages as failsafe - change and share with more select group. </li>
</ul>
<p>Have some cameras that need set up</p>
<p>Volunteer commitments for access</p>
<ul>
<li>Had classes and regular events</li>
<li>50/mo fee, full scholarship come in 2x/mo to take out trash</li>
<li>Assess task list - Noah
<ul>
<li>Trash, clean towels, Instructions posted for everything</li>
<li>Be around on a schedule to give tours, sign people up</li>
<li>Sweeping</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Area host approach - Dillon in Chicago with hundreds of members. Each shop had a PIC. People would compete to be the one in charge of that space bc it gave ownership and a person who you had a connection to.</li>
<li>Bounty of a month‚Äôs membership to do specific projects that fell outside of normal</li>
</ul>
<p>Official ‚Äúno-fly‚Äù list - maker community has some known bad entities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Collette has documentation on decisions made.</li>
<li>How does banned from altspace interact with ban from </li>
<li>One person on list was banned from Attic and generally considered to be fine with community but made problem in the space, saying feminism was interfering with his existence. Annoying but not necessarily enough to be banned from events.</li>
<li>Clear that we have ability to assess and plan</li>
<li>Perceptively awkward v. pushing too much, not going to learn</li>
<li>Nice not to have to do in context of the space.</li>
<li>Negative behavior flees to the shadows when positive culture and community are fostered. </li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<p>Need communication about what could be left. Intermix pro and casual members, part of the community encouragement. Public computer area.</p>
<p>Painting event - </p>
<p>Business Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Semi-pro space for a week with any available space for a week.</li>
<li>Bins could be ala cart - same rate</li>
<li>Kick extra in for storage as the chanel for premium, create gradient up to pro by square footage. Representative of load on the space.</li>
<li>Returns on charging extra for the metal shop may not be </li>
<li>Largest, most flexible fluid memberships have the most money. Imagining the use of the metal shop is a big marketing draw.</li>
<li>People might group projects. Open the endless predictable stream of cash.</li>
<li>Storage is the easiest way to rachet up. Flexibility/impulsivity - log into your account and increase your rate quickly. Passive upgrade by claiming a crate. Lowest friction, people have inertia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maker Bar in NJ - regular meetup group. Programming night, soldering night, prefab kits.</p>
<p>Scholarships host a class.</p>
<p>Free month for offering a class where attendees pay. Covers their membership. </p>
<p>Donation based day use breakdown.</p>
<p>,*David needs to make website handoff.</p>
<ul>
<li>Low barrier to entry and not painful if i don‚Äôt exit.</li>
<li>BM wholly owned subsidiary model. Could be entirely independent. Which model are we selecting and why?</li>
<li>Rent pro-space as a group</li>
<li>Volunteers staff from 9am-9pm weekdays, 10am - 10pm weekends, 6hr shift for access</li>
<li>Rejected walk-in day use for lack of a manager ($10 donation)</li>
<li>Balance of pro-space in back for meetings, potlucks, project storage.</li>
<li>300/mo pro, $75 access and bins</li>
<li>Metal shop users should pay a little more. Consumables, insurance, permitting.</li>
<li>Ask the members who used the space</li>
<li>19 pro members would pay the rent, 16 would be optimal
<ul>
<li>Currently 5 pro spaces, </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How much is it worth to Ignition - </li>
<li>Open community access with suggested donation during business hours, 24/7 access for monthly rate</li>
<li>Additional rate for metal shop</li>
<li>Incentive for longer term membership</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiawatha Art Space = $3,200/mo base rent, available end of Sept</li>
<li>Equinox - how do they lease?</li>
<li>existing makers space we pay for access - explored but not feasible.</li>
<li>Hybrid model - continuing current operation but adding Ignition membership.
<ul>
<li>Conversion process</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Free for everyone. We assume costs and supported by all INW membership ‚Äúdues‚Äù. </li>
<li>Segregated funds building for purchase.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setup</p>
<ul>
<li>Dirtiness gradient v. time of day use</li>
<li>Possibly move sewing area to back. </li>
<li>Semi walls</li>

<h2 id="assets"><a class="header" href="#assets">Assets</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Website lists - http://www.altspaceseattle.com/amenities-tools/</li>
<li>some stuff checked out from owners. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="costs"><a class="header" href="#costs">Costs</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Currently renting for 3k, with extension space would be $4,300. Owner (Ron) keen to rent together.  Water sewer covered</li>
<li>He‚Äôs more amenable to negotiating if it‚Äôs going to be taken over. Will be motivational since he‚Äôd otherwise spend a lot fixing it up. Offer / answer on sooner end. Could probably give tax deductible kickback written into lease.</li>
<li>Fire permit - metal shop, roughly $450/yr, there‚Äôs extra for metal shop consumables.</li>
<li>Internet $80/mo</li>
<li>Electricity varies from $40 - $100/mo billed every 2 months.</li>
<li>Insurance just lapsed, roughly $100 every 3rd month - liability insurance for the LLC.</li>
<li>Currently no renters insurance for theft. Haven‚Äôt had real theft. Had a breakin, guy came through back. Used to be a gate in back, now plywood. Not easy to get in, better for security but harder for access.</li>
<li>$115/year CPI updates.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="membership"><a class="header" href="#membership">Membership</a></h2>
<p>http://www.altspaceseattle.com/memberships-rates/</p>
<p>7 pro level members, 20 something $75 members, also got storage. Members have been self selecting because small space shared. Interactions very positive. Maker synergy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pro - </li>
<li>Basic - use of public spaces and tools. Not harsh about overnight storage, just can‚Äôt be entitled to the space. </li>
<li>Waivers - assumed risk</li>
<li>Roughly break even right now.</li>
<li>People have been reaching out for tours. We‚Äôre on the Seattle Maker database for folks looking for space. Tours staffed on Sundays. Garage door open and sandwich board out.</li>
<li>Gym membership - lots of people forget to cancel when they quit using. Some intentionally.</li>
<li>Regular members can‚Äôt give code out or leave anyone unsupervised. Pro-members allowed one assistant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rules for using the space - http://www.altspaceseattle.com/alt-rules/</p>
<h2 id="challenges"><a class="header" href="#challenges">Challenges</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Growing created other problems. Not everyone knows everyone creates lack of accountability. Lack of staff, nobody‚Äôs job to take care of it. </li>
<li>Attrition and vacancy has been the issue. Use the space professionally and personally. </li>
<li>Spring cleaning, stuff accumulates. Had to up membership rates in the back space for storage. Defuckification events. Goodwill/dumptruck/art run. </li>
<li>Personal tools in communal space. Upset when people used them. If you leave it on a common space, it gets used.</li>
<li>Kicking someone out? Management team votes and delegate talks to them - self selected pro members who show up and care, investment in the space. Only about 3-4 total with hundreds here. Once info shared and we have complaints haven‚Äôt had issues with agreement. Clear guidelines. Wasn‚Äôt ultimately a surprise to him. He‚Äôd been informed several times. </li>
<li>Min age 14 with parent, 16 without. Hasn‚Äôt been an issue but one teenager whose parent was a member came in to drink. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other"><a class="header" href="#other">Other</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Relationship with Coyote space. They let us use the courtyard.</li>
<li>Painter used to have workshops for at-risk youth. Too many people in too small a space. Liability consideration in </li>
<li>Small income stream of Seattle Poly meetup. Suggested donations ends up 50-60 per week. Takes over the space and prevents other usage. Probably not worth it. </li>
<li>Lots of freedom to make improvements/additions. E.g. unique keycode access.</li>
<li>Gate entry for meetings is handy to leave open rather than garage space access.</li>
<li>Signage - questions with Ron - smaller signs and placards. Probably wouldn‚Äôt have a problem. Get approval from city of seattle first.</li>
<li>Some of the garage neighbors are cool. Has a community feel. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lessons-learned"><a class="header" href="#lessons-learned">Lessons Learned</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Well crafted mission statements and values are critical</li>
<li>Explicit organizing documents that codify decision making processes are critical, as is a framework for updating those rules</li>
<li>Come and go memberships don't really work. People aren't invested in the space, don't make it better, and (depending on the person) trash shared infrastructure. If this is a model for the space you're thinking about moving forward, I highly recommend a more onerous tool / space use process. Probably even better are 6-12 month membership plans.</li>
</ul>
